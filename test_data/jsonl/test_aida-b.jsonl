{"id": "1163testb SOCCER", "text": "SOCCER - JAPAN GET LUCKY WIN , CHINA IN SURPRISE DEFEAT . Nadim Ladki AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday . But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan . China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net . Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area . The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time . Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders . Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria . Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net . It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes . Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal . Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute . Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence . Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did . Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us . The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . ' ' Japan , co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here . Hosts UAE play Kuwait and South Korea take on Indonesia on Saturday in Group A matches . All four teams are level with one point each from one game .

Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu . The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours . The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic . Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town . \" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , \" said Andrew , also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance .

Robert Galvin MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday . Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour . Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats . All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd . Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes . His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls . Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday . He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room . The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle . It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin . Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .

Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat . Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him . As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take . Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper .

Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago .

INDIANAPOLIS 1996-12-06 The injury-plagued Indianapolis Colts lost another quarterback on Thursday but last year 's AFC finalists rallied together to shoot down the Philadelphia Eagles 37-10 in a showdown of playoff contenders . Marshall Faulk rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns and Jason Belser returned an interception 44 yards for a score as the Colts improved to 8-6 , the same mark as the Eagles , who lost for the fourth time in five games . Paul Justin , starting for the sidelined Jim Harbaugh , was 14-of-23 for 144 yards and a touchdown for the the Colts , who played their last home game of the season . Indianapolis closes with games at Kansas City and Cincinnati . The Eagles were held without a touchdown until the final five seconds . Philadelphia , which fell from an NFC East tie with the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins , go on the road against the New York Jets and then entertain Arizona . The loss by Philadelphia allowed the idle Green Bay Packers ( 10-3 ) to clinch the first NFC playoff berth . The Colts won despite the absence of injured starting defensive tackle Tony Siragusa , cornerback Ray Buchanan and linebacker Quentin Coryatt . Faulk carried 16 times , including a 13-yard TD run in the first quarter and a seven-yard score early in the final period . Justin made his second straight start for Harbaugh , who has a knee injury . Justin suffered a sprained right shoulder in the third quarter and did not return . Third-stringer Kerwin Bell , a 1988 draft choice of the Miami Dolphins , made his NFL debut and was 5-of-5 for 75 yards , including a 20-yard scoring strike to Marvin Harrison in the third period . A 39-yard interference penalty against Philadelphia 's Troy Vincent set up Faulk 's first score around left end that capped an 80-yard march 5:17 into the game and the rout was on . Eagles quarterback Ty Detmer was 17-of-34 for 182 yards before he was benched . Ricky Watters , who leads the NFC in rushing , left the game after getting kneed to the helmet after gaining 33 yards on seven carries .

ROME 1996-12-06 Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday ( league positions in parentheses , all kick- off times GMT ) : Bologna ( 4 ) v Piacenza ( 13 ) 1330 Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn . Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack , Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday . Cagliari ( 16 ) v Reggiana ( 18 ) 1530 Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega . Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar Beiersdorfer . Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330 Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi . Lazio ( 12 ) v AS Roma ( 7 ) 1930 Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups . Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi , Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo , Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack . AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330 Can Milan sink any further ? Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed . Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio , with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield . Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury . Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330 In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala . Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini . Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330 Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago . Parma 's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury . Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi , scorer of eight goals . Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330 All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack . The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle . Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .

Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts . \" In 1970s , Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs . What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , \" Rosati told a news conference . Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato , chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee , of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland . Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews . Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two . \" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , \" Rosati said . Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . He said , however , that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called \" dead accounts \" as part of the compensation . \" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , \" Rosati said . Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims . The conservative Radical Democrats ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations . But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .

{"id": "1217testb INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC", "text": "INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE . Steven Silber WARSAW 1996-12-06 Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround . So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys . It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres . Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . \" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , \" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain . Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors . Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim . Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ) . Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins . He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share . But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic . Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity . \" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , \" he said . Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . \" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , \" van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland . Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made . -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700 ", "index": [[57, 63], [75, 81], [345, 352], [896, 902], [1166, 1172], [1310, 1316], [1352, 1358], [1394, 1401], [1406, 1413], [1433, 1439], [1685, 1693], [1700, 1709], [1733, 1739], [1790, 1793], [1845, 1850], [1922, 1931], [1974, 1980], [2475, 2489], [2535, 2540], [2562, 2568], [2586, 2591], [2691, 2696], [2737, 2743], [2943, 2948], [3057, 3066], [3127, 3135], [3410, 3416], [3499, 3507], [3544, 3550]], "wikipedia_ids": [32908, 22936, 18998750, 22936, 22936, 22936, 9239, 11867, 31717, 22936, 150133, 325070, 9889109, 419331, 74608, 4689264, 22936, 5321, 5321, 22936, 459244, 5321, 22936, 5321, 325070, 4793292, 22936, 4793292, 22936], "wikipedia_titles": ["Warsaw", "Poland", "Reuters", "Poland", "Poland", "Poland", "Europe", "Germany", "United_Kingdom", "Poland", "Heineken_N.V.", "Carlsberg_Group", "Okocim", "South_African_Breweries", "Tychy", "Australia", "Poland", "Czech_Republic", "Czech_Republic", "Poland", "Central_European_Free_Trade_Agreement", "Czech_Republic", "Poland", "Czech_Republic", "Carlsberg_Group", "Heineken", "Poland", "Heineken", "Poland"]}

{"id": "1223testb Britain", "text": "Britain sets conditions to clear American alliance . Edna Fernandes LONDON 1996-12-06 The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine the case last month . \" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S. , \" he said . His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed . Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared . The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe . American 's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view the terms as a \" deal breaker . \" However , it called the conditions \" more severe \" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances . British Airways 's initial response was that \" unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . \" It added that it would be \" prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . \" The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter . It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route . The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme .

{"id": "1238testb Wall", "text": "Wall St speculates about Santa Fe savior . Brendan Intindola NEW YORK 1996-12-06 Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp . Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday . Wall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a \" bear hug , \" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters . Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer . They said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term . Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer . Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit . Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said . A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list . Homestake , based in San Francisco , operates gold mines in the United States , Australia , Chile and Canada . Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million . Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million . Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana . PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion . \" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number . One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , \" he said . \" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things . But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , \" the analyst added . Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares . In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 . \" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' \" said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont . Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a \" a 32 cent bid \" because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter \" mailed \" to Santa Fe 's board . -- Wall Street Desk , 212-859-1734 .

{"id": "1241testb Multinational", "text": "Multinational commander going back to east Zaire . Jonathan Wright NAIROBI 1996-12-06 The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside . Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of Goma . If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire , he said . \" Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , \" he said . General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home . The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area . Kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . \" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda , \" Young told reporters . But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . \" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . \" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , \" he said . Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said : \" It would have to be in the last resort . It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger . Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire . \" Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter , the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security . \" I know their ( the Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , \" the general added . He denied that his contacts , criticised by Kinshasa , with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations . \" I do n't negotiate , \" he said . \" I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . \" Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu .

Raphael Kopessoua BANGUI 1996-12-06 A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui , a government minister said on Friday . With violence spiralling out of control , France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers . \" France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , \" President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso . \" French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , \" he said . Public Service Minister David Dofara , who is the head of the national Red Cross , told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son , who was not named . Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 . Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong . The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital . The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui . The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said Dofora and other witnesses . The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre . A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged . Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse 's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands . Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui , which is patrolled by French troops with tanks , is deserted . Shops and businesses have remained shut this week . The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war . Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui \" in the coming hours \" with the heads of state of Gabon , Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels . The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit . His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission . Patasse , who won Central Africa 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign . Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure . Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising . Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre . Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad . Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos . Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes . An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups . In Thursday 's fighting , French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre .

Simona de Logu RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday . The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said . The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said . \" Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences . Our statistics are the highest for everything , \" Hakme said . \" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market . People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . \" A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy . There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP . Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there . Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . \" What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , \" he said . Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each . Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . \" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States , \" SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said . \" Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . \" Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent . Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

DILI , East Timor 1996-12-06 East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize . Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people . It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo . The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta , who lives in self-exile in Australia . The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital . \" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta ... will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to East Timor ) , \" Alatas said on Friday . He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) in Jakarta . Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta 's rule in the territory . Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor , a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta 's move . Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo .

Vithoon Amorn RANGOON 1996-12-06 About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said . Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute . There were no clashes . \" They are now back in the YIT campus , \" an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone . One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities . But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said . They were singing peacefully . On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October . On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . She was allowed to move freely on Thursday . The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon . The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising . Thousands were killed or imprisoned . Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government . They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . \" We still want government answers to our demands . We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , \" one student said . But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) . Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students . But they have said both parties had a \" moral link \" in that they were against police brutality and injustice . The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October . The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration . The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising .

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in Singapore . Bill Jordan , general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was \" outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world \" . Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links . \" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , \" Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade . The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda . Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . Bill Brett , chairman of the ILO Workers Group , told Reuters before the news conference he was \" not too surprised , but very disappointed \" that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . \" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , \" he said , adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda .

Speaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard Eglin , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems .

K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes . For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added . \" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , \" he said . Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes . In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes . One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India . \" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , \" he said . -- Singapore Newsroom ( 65-8703305 ) ", "index": [[0, 6], [52, 61], [73, 79], [337, 343], [803, 809], [1410, 1422], [1563, 1568]], "wikipedia_ids": [14533, 27318, 14533, 14533, 14533, 19385859, 14533], "wikipedia_titles": ["India", "Singapore", "India", "India", "India", "Rubber_Board", "India"]}

George Nishiyama TOKYO 1996-12-06 Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday . In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen . This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . \" I think his views on ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , \" said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank . Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar . \" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger . In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , \" he said . \" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , \" said Sumitomo 's Note . Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo , said : \" Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . \" Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply . He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the \" Sakakibara ceiling \" for the dollar following the remark . Adding to the comments by \" Mr Yen \" , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark . \" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , \" Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun . \" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , \" said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co . Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan 's economy . \" There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen . The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , \" said Taisuke Tanaka , market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo . Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative . \" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , \" a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday .

{"id": "1271testb Lebanon", "text": "Lebanon sentences pro-Israeli warlord to death . Haitham Haddadin BEIRUT 1996-12-06 A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges . The court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war . Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel . Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state . He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit . The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel 's side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods . Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel . No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon . Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies . Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd . Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd \" a great Lebanese patriot \" , said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges .

As Glenn Lawhon , a rural Florida minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for the murder of Lester Lawhon . Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris , who was present at the execution . \" I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God , \" he quoted Mills as saying . Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam . Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty . Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him .

CHICAGO 1996-12-06 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday . The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children . \" Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , \" Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association . \" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them . Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction . Let 's respect their territories , \" he said . Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children . He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed . Don Rieck , president of the National Animal Control Association , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female . The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , German shepherds , cocker spaniels and Dalmatians . \" The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique . Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman . Today , Rottweilers are on the way up , \" Rieck said . If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away .

Evelyn Leopold UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06 Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election . The nominees , according to diplomats , are : Kofi Annan of Ghana , the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania , the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast , its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger , the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference . Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana , the Ivory Coast , Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said . It was not known if other candidates would step forward . Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria , a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country . Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race . His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse . The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him . The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee . The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali 's term expires .

{"id": "1312testb Cyberspace", "text": "Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks . Elif Kaban GENEVA 1996-12-06 In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age . But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether . After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time . Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases . \" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , \" a frustrated Western delegate said . \" They announced they will start evening sessions next week . \" Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices . \" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles . It 's fair use . We can read sports statistics or stock prices . But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , \" said James Love , a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology . \" None of the treaties are ready to move . These people do n't understand what they 're doing . \" At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce . Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old Berne Convention . But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries . A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet . Mongolia 's state copyright official , Gundegma Jargalshaihan , said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda . \" We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia , \" he added . Alexander Bavykin , deputy legal chief at Russia 's foreign ministry , said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace . He too had never browsed the Net . \" I 've never tried it and why should I ? There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , \" he said . A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse . \" Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , \" said Marc Pearl , vice-president of the Information Technology Association of America , a trade association of U.S. network companies opposing the treaties . \" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here . People here do n't understand Internet technology . Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . \" Before the Internet , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood .

Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations . Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said , who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan . The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold . The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold . \" Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , \" the source said .

Ramthan Hussain SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said . \" As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO , \" said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A . \" Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product . \" The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 . In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered . That would have meant Geneva . But Singapore had the support of other WTO members . Derek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore 's hosting of the conference \" carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . \" There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but \" more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market \" , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore . At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector . Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks . \" There is tension at every step of the way , \" since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said . Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore , \" however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . \" From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry , Tan said . A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean \" would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , \" Tan said . \" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy . \" Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda . \" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain , \" he said . \" But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this . I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . \" ", "index": [[10, 19], [45, 48], [67, 76], [88, 97], [130, 154], [157, 160], [374, 383], [428, 431], [498, 507], [707, 711], [900, 909], [926, 934], [991, 1004], [1053, 1056], [1111, 1117], [1124, 1133], [1159, 1162], [1211, 1238], [1256, 1265], [1473, 1482], [1669, 1701], [1777, 1780], [1811, 1818], [1938, 1941], [1949, 1958], [1996, 2010], [2046, 2055], [2135, 2144], [2479, 2488], [2704, 2713], [2763, 2772], [3048, 3057], [3117, 3126], [3157, 3160], [3347, 3356]], "wikipedia_ids": [27318, 33873, 27318, 27318, 33873, 33873, 27318, 33873, 27318, 3434750, 27318, 3434750, 950865, 33873, 12521, 27318, 33873, 3806329, 27318, 27318, 286880, 33873, 31843, 33873, 27318, 9317, 27318, 27318, 27318, 27318, 27318, 27318, 27318, 33873, 27318], "wikipedia_titles": ["Singapore", "World_Trade_Organization", "Singapore", "Singapore", "World_Trade_Organization", "World_Trade_Organization", "Singapore", "World_Trade_Organization", "Singapore", "United_States", "Singapore", "United_States", "Mickey_Kantor", "World_Trade_Organization", "Geneva", "Singapore", "World_Trade_Organization", "Institute_of_Policy_Studies_(Singapore)", "Singapore", "Singapore", "National_University_of_Singapore", "World_Trade_Organization", "Uruguay", "World_Trade_Organization", "Singapore", "European_Union", "Singapore", "Singapore", "Singapore", "Singapore", "Singapore", "Singapore", "Singapore", "World_Trade_Organization", "Singapore"]}

But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up , Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute . The Koreans then appeared to relax , allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match . Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out .

Bure received a double-minor penalty for high-sticking with 2:22 left in the first period of Wednesday 's 7-6 overtime win by Vancouver after colliding with Galley in Buffalo zone . Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to the game . \" Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent , \" said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out the suspension . \" Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr Bure 's actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent , there can be no excuse for this type of conduct , \" Burke said . Bure , who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games , will miss Saturday 's home game against Ottawa .
