It is almost endemic to New South Wales, with a range from  northward, extending only barely into Queensland (Stradbroke Island). It inhabits soft-substrate habitats and has been reported from depths of 45-300 meters (150-980 ft), though it is most common on the outer continental shelf at depths of 100-160 meters (330-520 ft).\n\nThis species attains a maximum length of 42 cm (17 in). It has a flattened  disk about as wide as long, with rounded corners and straight anterior margins. There is a skirt-like nasal curtain in front of the mouth, without lateral lobes. The tail is short and stout, measuring 64-76% the length of the disk and bearing a serrated spine. The tail ends in a small ; there are no dorsal fins or lateral folds. The skin is devoid of s. The coloration is uniformly yellowish above, sometimes with an ill-defined brown stripe running down the back.\n\nThe yellowback stingaree is likely  with low fecundity, as in other stingarees.

It is a  residential neighborhood.

He was followed by other members of his . Neither he nor they liked urban life much, and eventually he bought the land along Rapp Road where they all moved.\n\nHalf of the original purchase was taken by the state for road projects in the 1970s. The remaining half, today's , has many of the original buildings. Most of the original families' descendants still live there. It is a rare intact example of a chain migration community from the Great Migration.\"\n\nRapp Road is located in the long, narrow western protrusion of Albany known as the Pine Bush. The portion of the street on which the district is located lies between Pine Lane and the South Frontage Road of Washington Avenue Extension. It is just north of the boundary between the city and the town of Guilderland.\n\nTo the southeast is Crossgates Mall. Wooded lands on the east and west serve as a buffer between it and the mall and various other commercial and office developments in those directions. It is further isolated from any other residential neighborhoods by Interstates 87 and 90, both part of the New York State Thruway, to the north and east. The land is generally level.\n\nThe district is formed by the 27 lots that remain of the two original purchases that created the neighborhood, on both sides of the road. There are 21 buildings on those lots, all but two of which are contributing properties. One property has two stone piers marking its driveway, both of which are considered contributing objects. The buildings are all wood frame residences, a mix of cottages and .\n\nThe Reverend Louis W. Parson and his wife migrated to Albany from Shubuta, Mississippi in 1927. He founded the First Church of God in Christ in Albany. In four trips to Mississippi, Parson encouraged friends and family to move to Albany and join the church. Many friends and family did, during the 1930s and 1940s. Some were s who owed money to their landlords. Eventually the majority of Shubuta moved to Albany, part of the 400,000 African Americans who left the South during what has been called the Great Migration around World War I seeking better opportunities.\n\nDespite pressure from the city government to not bring in anymore unemployed people due to the Depression, Parson continued doing so throughout the 1930s. But many of the migrants did not like life in the . There were bars, brothels and gambling houses in the neighborhood, affronts to their religious values that they did not want their children to be near. Many had also come from rural areas, and found city life hard to adjust to. Some went back to Mississippi.\n\nParson found two  parcels of undeveloped land in the Pine Bush for the community to move to between 1930 and 1933. They saved money and built, by themselves, houses similar to those they had lived in in Mississippi. After the purchases were fully closed in 1942, two years after Parson's death, families began building their own houses with help from friends and family over the next decades. Many began growing crops and raising animals on the land, becoming .  During the World War II years, especially, building materials were hard to obtain, and thus one family found they could complete a small shotgun house but not the larger house that they had started.\n\nAt its peak, 23 families lived on Rapp Road. The neighborhood remained intact until 1971, when the state planned the Washington Avenue Extension to better connect the city and its growing western suburbs. This required eminent domain proceedings against the northern parcel. Most of the homeowners moved away. One who lived at what is today the middle of the extension chose instead to have her house moved, and today it is at the north end of the street, 8 Rapp Road, 300 feet (90 m) south of its original location.\n\nThe community has remained intact despite the large-scale development of the surrounding area.

Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It has an  of 3.043, making it one of the brighter members of the constellation. The distance to this star is roughly 2,800&nbsp;s (800&nbsp;parsecs), with a 34% margin of error.\n\nThis is a massive supergiant star with a stellar classification of B3&nbsp;Ia, indicating that, at the age of around 7&nbsp;million years, it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now undergoing nuclear fusion of helium to generate energy. It has about 21 times the mass of the Sun and 65 times the Sun's radius. In all likelihood, it will end its life as a Type II supernova.\n\nOmicron2 Canis Majoris is one of the  known, as it radiates about 220,000 times as much luminosity as the Sun from its outer envelope at a temperature of 15,500&nbsp;K. At this heat, the star is glowing with the blue-white hue of a B-type star. This star is classified as an Alpha Cygni-type variable star that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude +2.93 to +3.08 over a 24.44&nbsp;day interval. It is losing mass from its stellar wind at the rate of around  times the mass of the Sun per year, or the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 500 million years.\n\nWhile this star lies in the field of view of the open cluster named Collinder 121, it is unlikely to be a member. In fact, its optical neighbor, \u03bf1 Canis Majoris has a much higher likelihood of 23.1% based upon its proper motion being a closer match to the motion of the cluster. Although they are located near each other on the celestial sphere, \u03bf1 CMa and \u03bf2 CMa are most likely not  to each other as they appear to lie many light years apart.\n\nIn the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Thanih al Adzari (\u062a\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0644\u0639\u0630\u0627\u0631\u064a - taanii al-a\u00f0\u0101rii), which was translated into Latin as Secunda Virginum, meaning the second virgin.

{"id": "Gender_binary", "bracket": "0.8-0.9", "text": "The gender binary, also referred to as gender binarism (sometimes shortened to just binarism), is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct, opposite and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine.  It is one general type of a gender system. As one of the core principles of genderism, it can describe a social boundary that discourages people from crossing or mixing gender roles, or from identifying with third (or more) forms of gender expression altogether. It can also represent some of the prejudices which stigmatize intersex and transgender people, especially those that are genderqueer-identified \u2014 individuals who may not always fit neatly into the gender binary.\n\nThe term describes the system in which a society splits people into male and female gender roles, gender identities and attributes. Gender role is one aspect of a gender binary. Many societies have used the gender binary to divide and organize people, though the ways this happens differs between societies. A universal aspect of the gender binaries is that women give birth. Gender binaries exist as a means of bringing order, though some, such as Riki Wilchins in GenderQueer: Voices from Beyond the Sexual Binary, argue that gender binaries divide and polarize society. Certain notable religions are often used as authorities for the justification and description. Islam, for example, teaches that mothers are the primary care givers to their children and Catholics only allow males to serve as their priests.\n\nExceptions have widely existed to the gender binary in the form of specific transgender identities. Besides the biological identification of intersex individuals, elements of the both or neither sexes have been taken by people biologically female and male such as Two-Spirited Native Americans and hijra of India. In the contemporary West, transgender people break the gender binary in the form of genderqueer. s have a unique place in relation to the gender binary because in many cases their gender expression transitions from one side of the gender binary to the other but still conforms to the gender binary itself.\n\nMany scholars have contested the existence of a clear gender binary. There is an increasing amount of research that illustrates that the evidence for dividing humans into the two distinct categories of men and women is problematic and a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, Judith Lorber explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups \u201ceven though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences.\u201d  Lorber argues that this corroborates the fact that the gender binary is quite arbitrary and leads to false expectations of both genders. Instead, there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without \u201cprior assumptions about who is like whom.\u201d  By allowing for a more fluid approach to gender, people will be better able to identify themselves however they choose, and scholarly research will find different similarities and differences.\n\nA further issue with the gender binary is the insistence that men are  and women are . This reduces options for people to act outside of their gender role\n", "index": [[120, 123], [128, 134], [140, 152], [189, 198], [203, 211], [242, 255], [290, 299], [319, 334], [383, 394], [447, 464], [511, 520], [528, 538], [539, 547], [552, 563], [598, 609], [758, 762], [767, 773], [774, 785], [788, 805], [1139, 1152], [1358, 1363], [1449, 1458], [1768, 1778], [1781, 1797], [1802, 1807], [1811, 1816], [1838, 1842], [1902, 1913], [2401, 2414], [3238, 3249]], "wikipedia_ids": [26805, 38076, 1058899, 240058, 240059, 29880756, 37046428, 61117, 43094, 162025, 77182, 2649767, 26652964, 19904525, 264989, 1822282, 20913864, 43094, 162025, 1164715, 6037917, 606848, 23929145, 2402376, 301626, 14533, 21208200, 264989, 36948008, 43094], "wikipedia_titles": ["Sex", "Gender", "Binary opposition", "Masculinity", "Femininity", "Gender system", "Genderism", "Taboo", "Gender role", "Gender identity", "Prejudice", "Social stigma", "Intersex", "Transgender", "Non-binary gender", "Male", "Female", "Gender role", "Gender identity", "Riki Wilchins", "Islam", "Catholic Church", "Two-spirit", "Indigenous peoples of the Americas", "Hijra (South Asia)", "India", "Western world", "Non-binary gender", "Judith Lorber", "Gender role"]}

A youth movement, Front de la jeunesse, was formed, although the party was also closely linked to GUD.\n\nPositioned on the far right, the PFN also sought links with the more mainstream right and joined former members of the Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te in campaigning for Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1974. The group also launched its own well-produced journal, Initiative nationale, organised protests against the 1977 visit to Paris by Leonid Brezhnev (on the pretext of his support for the Polisario Front, which had taken French hostages) and in 1979 launched the Eurodroite alliance with the Italian Social Movement, Fuerza Nueva and the Belgian PFN. The party ran for the 1979 European elections under the name Union fran\u00e7aise pour l'Eurodroite (led by Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour), winning 1.3% of the vote. They would go on to have members elected to town councils in 1983 as part of the Rally for the Republic (RPR)-Union for French Democracy (UDF) list. Following the 1979 European elections, Roland Gaucher, who had been in charge of Initiative nationale, left the PFN along with Fran\u00e7ois Brigneau to join again the National Front (FN).\n\nThe party also endured failure, notably in 1981 when they were unable to secure the 500 signatures necessary to get Pascal Gauchon as a candidate for the presidency. Following this set-back leadership fell into the hands of young members Roland H\u00e9lie, Didier Lecerf, Jack Marchal and Olivier Cazal, with former leaders such as Herv\u00e9 Novelli and Alain Robert leaving to join the National Centre of Independents and Peasants.

{"id": "Love's_Welcome_at_Bolsover", "bracket": "0.6-0.7", "text": "'Love's Welcome at Bolsover' (alternative archaic spelling, 'Balsover') is the final masque composed by Ben Jonson. It was performed on 30 July 1634, three years before the poet's death, and published in 1641.\n\nThe masque was not produced by the Stuart Court in one of the royal palaces around London, as many of Jonson's notable early masques were. Rather it was staged by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (at the time, he was the Earl of Newcastle) at Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, in honor of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria. Newcastle had put on a Jonson masque for his royal visitors at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire the year before: The King's Entertainment at Welbeck, performed on 21 May 1633. It was such a success that the King requested another on his 1634 royal progress. The Duke spent between \u00a314,000 and \u00a315,000 on staging the Bolsover masque and providing for his royal guests and their attendants, which was more than double the \u00a34,000 to \u00a35,000 he'd spent for the Welbeck entertainment the previous year. (The Masque of Beauty, one of Jonson's early Court masques, has cost \u00a34,000 to stage in 1608, and was considered exorbitantly expensive at the time.)\n\nIn Love's Welcome, Jonson continued the mockery of Inigo Jones that he'd practiced for two decades, starting  (1614) and continuing through The Masque of Augurs (1622), Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion (1624), The Staple of News (1626), and A Tale of a Tub (1633). In this masque, Jones is \"Colonel Iniquo Vitruvius.\"\n\nThe masque was staged in what was called the \"little castle\" at Bolsover, a then-recent (Jacobean) construction. The pillared hall there was furnished with five brilliantly-colored paintings on the theme of The Senses; Jonson alludes to the paintings in his text. The show was described by local witnesses as \"stupendous,\" more than adequate to establish Newcastle's reputation as the greatest \"prince...in all the northern quarter\" of the kingdom. Perhaps the most visually striking element in the masque lay in the two Cupids, Eros (Love) and Anteros (Love Returned), who descended \"from the clouds\" bearing fronds of palms.\n\nThe masque was published in 1641 in the second folio collection of Jonson's works\n", "index": [[85, 91], [104, 114], [204, 208], [246, 252], [374, 414], [462, 477], [481, 491], [510, 519], [530, 545], [610, 617], [621, 636], [654, 689], [711, 715], [1039, 1059], [1126, 1130], [1240, 1251], [1300, 1304], [1329, 1349], [1351, 1355], [1358, 1400], [1402, 1406], [1409, 1427], [1429, 1433], [1440, 1455], [1457, 1461], [2186, 2227]], "wikipedia_ids": [74909, 48261, 226378, 253174, 194444, 143019, 71070, 7426, 20949403, 7598798, 68049, 10099230, 226386, 9026957, 226487, 165453, 226409, 9967127, 226398, 9747851, 226396, 9010672, 226394, 9015125, 226386, 9395552], "wikipedia_titles": ["Masque", "Ben Jonson", "1641 in literature", "House of Stuart", "William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle", "Bolsover Castle", "Derbyshire", "Charles I of England", "Henrietta Maria", "Welbeck Abbey", "Nottinghamshire", "The King's Entertainment at Welbeck", "1633 in literature", "The Masque of Beauty", "1608 in literature", "Inigo Jones", "1614 in literature", "The Masque of Augurs", "1622 in literature", "Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion", "1624 in literature", "The Staple of News", "1626 in literature", "A Tale of a Tub (play)", "1633 in literature", "Ben Jonson folios"]}

{"id": "Rugby_union_in_Asia", "bracket": "0.4-0.5", "text": "Rugby union is a growing sport in Asia, governed by the Asian Rugby Football Union (ARFU).  there are 28 ARFU member unions, of whom 15 are full members of the International Rugby Board (IRB), and six further associate members of the IRB in Asia. The flagship tournament for promoting the sport in Asia is the Asian Five Nations, which launched in 2008, and which most recently in 2011 saw the national teams of Hong Kong (national team), Japan (national team), Kazakhstan (national team), Sri Lanka (national team) and the UAE, compete in the main tournament.\n\nThe sport in Asia is currently dominated by Japan, the only Asian nation to be represented on the IRB's executive council. The Japanese national team are so far the only Asian team to have competed in the Rugby World Cup, having appeared in all seven tournaments so far. Japan have been announced as the hosts of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and will be the first Asian hosts of the tournament. Under the Japanese bid, Hong Kong and Singapore will also host matches.\n\nSixteen Asian teams are full members of the International Rugby Board, though one (Guam) is arguably in Oceania, whilst the Arabian Gulf team [sic] represents five countries; Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The full list is:\n\nThere are also six Asian associate members of the IRB:\n\nLike Georgia and Russia, and as in , Armenia, Azerbaijan and Israel play in Europe, though Kazakhstan does not.\n\n===1991 World Cup===\n\nThe 1991 World Cup was the first to operate a qualification system, the 1987 WC having been invitation-only. In the qualifying stage, Asia was combined with Oceania and given two berths. Only four countries took part; Japan, South Korea, Tonga and Western Samoa  (Australia, Fiji and New Zealand were automatic qualifiers). Played as a four-team round-robin, Western Samoa and Japan finished first and second respectively courtesy of Japan's 28-16 win over Tonga, with the Japanese becoming the first Asian team to appear at the World Cup.\n\nAlthough they lost their first two games and did not qualify for the quarter-finals, Japan secured third spot in  with a 52-8 win over Zimbabwe.\n\nFor the 1995 WC, Asia held its own tournament, with the winner qualifying for the finals. This time eight countries entered (Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand), and were split into two groups, with the winners of each group playing each other for the single qualification berth. The final play-off saw Japan beat South Korea 26-11.\n\nThe group stages showed the inequalities in the Asian game; Japan won 103-9 against Malaysia, whilst Hong Kong thrashed Singapore 164-13. The World Cup itself did little to showcase Asian rugby, as Japan lost every game, including a humiliating 145-17 defeat against the All Blacks.\n\nFor the 1999 WC, Asia was given an extra qualification spot, albeit a repechage one. The same eight countries entered the qualification stages, but to avoid the scorelines witnessed in the previous competition, it was held on a three-stage basis; Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand competing in the first round-robin (with Sri Lanka going through); Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan in the second round (with Taiwan progressing); and then Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the third round. Japan again emerged victorious, with a 134-6 win over Taiwan going some way to regain the pride lost in the finals in South Africa four years earlier. South Korea took part in the repechage, beating Holland 108-45 on aggregate in the first round, before losing 140-41 over two legs to Tonga. Japan once again lost all their games in the World Cup proper.\n\nAsia retained its single berth plus repechage spot (vs. Oceania) in the 2003 WC qualifiers. This time, eleven teams took part, with the Arabian Gulf, China and Kazakhstan joining the fray.\n\nBefore Japan and South Korea entered the competition, the other nine teams were split into three round-robin pools, with the winners (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) then playing another round-robin with the top team (Taiwan) going on to the final pool with Japan and South Korea, which would decide the automatic and repechage qualifying spots. Japan again emerged victorious, beating their previous score against Taiwan in a 155-3 win at home (their largest ever win), followed by a 120-3 scoreline in the away match. South Korea again finished second, also thrashing Taiwan 119-7, and repeated their previous repechage performance, losing 194-0 over two legs to the Tongans.\n\nThirteen teams competed in the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2007 WC, Guam and India joining the competition for the first time.\n\nAnother new format was tried; this one more complex than previously; The first round, played in 2005, consisted of four \"divisions\"; 1, 2, 3a and 3b. In the second round, the top two of Division One (2005) and the winner of Division Two (2005) would form Division One (2006), whilst the bottom team of Division One (2005), the second (of three) in Division Two (2005), and the winner of a play-off between the Division 3a (2005) and Division 3b (2005) champions would form Division Two (2006). In the third round, the top two from Division One (2006) and the winner of Division Two (2006) would play a round-robin to decide the final placings.\n\nHong Kong, Japan and Korea formed Division One (2005), with Hong Kong finishing bottom and replaced by Arabian Gulf, who had won Division Two (2005). Taiwan finished bottom of Division Two, and were replaced by Sri Lanka, winners of the 3a-3b play-off over Kazakhstan. In the second round, Arabian Gulf finished bottom of Division One (2006), and were replaced in the final round by Hong Kong, who won Division Two (2006). In the final group, Japan again emerged victorious, sealing their place at the World Cup with a comprehensive 54-0 defeat of South Korea, who went on to lose to the Tongans for the third successive time, this time 85-3 in a one-off match in Wellington\n", "index": [[0, 11], [34, 38], [56, 82], [160, 185], [310, 328], [348, 352], [381, 385], [412, 421], [423, 436], [439, 444], [446, 459], [462, 472], [474, 487], [490, 499], [501, 514], [524, 527], [767, 782], [879, 899], [992, 1001], [1071, 1096], [1131, 1138], [1151, 1168], [1202, 1209], [1211, 1217], [1219, 1223], [1225, 1237], [1246, 1266], [1550, 1557], [1635, 1642], [1716, 1721], [1726, 1739], [1742, 1751], [1753, 1757], [1762, 1773], [2154, 2162], [2173, 2180], [2290, 2299], [2308, 2316], [2318, 2327], [2342, 2351], [2353, 2359], [2364, 2372], [2839, 2846], [3526, 3533], [3755, 3762], [3819, 3831], [3833, 3838], [3843, 3853], [4616, 4623], [4625, 4629], [4634, 4639], [5994, 6004]], "wikipedia_ids": [25405, 689, 13292391, 266858, 13435780, 15832226, 27879275, 13404, 4921161, 15573, 759561, 16642, 3039333, 26750, 8051528, 31372669, 25406, 18884664, 27318, 266858, 22621, 7940119, 18933277, 7515890, 22316, 349303, 69328, 380206, 22621, 1074629, 1048972, 620967, 1074616, 154957, 2703015, 526056, 4921161, 8081793, 8082630, 8051528, 8082065, 8082794, 266016, 4863079, 25279872, 7940119, 8081609, 3039333, 375446, 8081254, 2210947, 33804], "wikipedia_titles": ["Rugby union", "Asia", "Asia Rugby", "World Rugby", "Asia Rugby Championship", "2008 Asian Five Nations", "2011 Asian Five Nations", "Hong Kong", "Hong Kong national rugby union team", "Japan", "Japan national rugby union team", "Kazakhstan", "Kazakhstan national rugby union team", "Sri Lanka", "Sri Lanka national rugby union team", "United Arab Emirates national rugby union team", "Rugby World Cup", "2019 Rugby World Cup", "Singapore", "World Rugby", "Oceania", "Arabian Gulf rugby union team", "Bahrain", "Kuwait", "Oman", "Saudi Arabia", "United Arab Emirates", "1987 Rugby World Cup", "Oceania", "Tonga national rugby union team", "Samoa national rugby union team", "Australia national rugby union team", "Fiji national rugby union team", "New Zealand national rugby union team", "Zimbabwe national rugby union team", "1995 Rugby World Cup", "Hong Kong national rugby union team", "Malaysia national rugby union team", "Singapore national rugby union team", "Sri Lanka national rugby union team", "Chinese Taipei national rugby union team", "Thailand national rugby union team", "1999 Rugby World Cup", "Netherlands national rugby union team", "2003 Rugby World Cup", "Arabian Gulf rugby union team", "China national rugby union team", "Kazakhstan national rugby union team", "2007 Rugby World Cup", "Guam national rugby union team", "India national rugby union team", "Wellington"]}

At the village of Ma\u0107edonce Retkocersko the Jablanica receives the left tributary \u010cokotinska reka (Cyrillic: \u0427\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430), turns southeast and the region of Jablanica begins from that point.\n\nThe upper Jablanica region is made of narrow river valley on the southern slopes of the  and Radan mountains, in the westernmost corner of Jablanica District and near the border of the  in Kosovo. The river flows eastward, passing regional center of Medve\u0111a and the villages of Rujkovac and \u0160ilovo, before reaching the town of Lebane where the Jablanica enters the lower part of its valley and flows for the next 48 km in low Field of Leskovac, part of the depression of Leskovac, which itself is part of the composite valley of the Ju\u017ena Morava. In the region, near Lebane, a famed archeological find of  (Iustiniana Prima) is located.\n\nThe Jablanica flows next to the villages of \u017ddeglovo, Vranovce, Bo\u0161njace, Turekovac and Stopanje, reaches Vinarce, the northern suburb of the city of Leskovac, and turns north. First it flows parallel to the Veternica river, to which it is connected by canal at the village of Zalu\u017eje, then parallel to the Ju\u017ena Morava. After the villages of Dupljane and Pe\u010denjevce it turns east and flows into the Ju\u017ena Morava. From Pe\u010denjevce, a parallel flow (canal) begins, connecting the Jablanica and s, some 15 km to the north.\n\nThrough Ju\u017ena Morava, the Jablanica belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, draining an area of 895 km\u00b2 itself. It's not navigable and has an average discharge of 6 m\u00b3/s, which in rainy years grows much higher, so the river floods its valley causing lots of material damage.

The prize is described by the Foundation as being \"awarded annually\", but is not in fact awarded every year: only six prizes were awarded in the 2000s (decade) in most fields, and four in Physics.\n\nThe Wolf Prizes in physics and chemistry are often considered the most prestigious awards in those fields after the Nobel Prize. The prize in physics has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize \u2013 from the 26 prizes awarded between 1978 and 2010, fourteen winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, five of those in the following year.\n\nIn medicine, the prize is probably the third most prestigious, after the Nobel Prize and the Lasker Award. Until the establishment of the Abel Prize, the Wolf Prize was probably the closest equivalent of a \"Nobel Prize in Mathematics\", since the more prestigious Fields Medal was only awarded every four years to mathematicians under forty years old. The Prize in Agriculture has likewise been equated to a \"Nobel Prize in Agriculture\".\n\nFor past Wolf Prize laureates, see the separate lists for Agriculture, Chemistry, Mathematics, Medicine, Physics and Arts\n", "index": [[47, 53], [323, 329], [337, 352], [365, 381], [417, 421], [474, 485], [487, 496], [498, 509], [511, 519], [521, 528], [537, 541], [1323, 1335], [1368, 1378], [1493, 1505], [1726, 1737], [1739, 1748], [1750, 1761], [1763, 1771], [1773, 1780], [1785, 1789]], "wikipedia_ids": [9282173, 9282173, 12321305, 12271740, 5042481, 714510, 714440, 714278, 714499, 714321, 714281, 717081, 159285, 10859, 714510, 714440, 714278, 714499, 714321, 714281], "wikipedia_titles": ["Israel", "Israel", "Wolf Foundation", "Ricardo Wolf", "Cuba", "Wolf Prize in Agriculture", "Wolf Prize in Chemistry", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics", "Wolf Prize in Medicine", "Wolf Prize in Physics", "Wolf Prize in Arts", "Lasker Award", "Abel Prize", "Fields Medal", "Wolf Prize in Agriculture", "Wolf Prize in Chemistry", "Wolf Prize in Mathematics", "Wolf Prize in Medicine", "Wolf Prize in Physics", "Wolf Prize in Arts"]}

He was also one of the many nephews of Robert Guiscard and Roger I of Sicily and in his early life Richard participated with his two famous uncles to the conquest of Sicily.\n\nIn 1097, Richard joined his cousins, Bohemund of Taranto and Tancred, on the First Crusade. Richard and Tancred were notable for being among the few Crusaders who could speak Arabic, an ability doubtlessly learned during the wars in Sicily, which had a strong Arab presence. Anna Komnene relates that when Richard crossed the Adriatic Sea, his ship was attacked and captured by the Byzantine fleet, who had mistaken him for a pirate. He was soon released and joined the main Crusader army marching through Bulgaria and Hungary. Along with Tancred, Richard refused to swear an oath of fidelity to the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus, preferring to cross the Bosphorus in secret.\n\nRichard was one of the commanders at the Battle of Dorylaeum in summer 1097. 1098, Richard and Tancred joined Bohemund at the siege of Antioch. Richard was among those captured with Bohemund in 1100 when ambushed by the Danishmends at the Battle of Melitene. From there Richard was sent to the emperor Alexius, who imprisoned him in Constantinople before he was finally released in 1103. His cousin Tancred then appointed him governor of Edessa in the winter of 1104, a city which he ruled until 1108. He was bitterly hated by the citizens of Edessa for being ruthless and greedy. During this time, Richard also acted as a diplomat, traveling to France and Italy and arranging the marriage of Bohemund to the princess Constance of France. He was a witness of the 1108 Treaty of Devol. He also participated in the ultimately disastrous campaigns Bohemund waged against the emperor Alexius, but may have been secretly plotting with Alexius against Bohemund. After Bohemund's death in 1111, Richard retired to Marash, where he died in the great earthquake of November 29, 1114.\n\nBy his wife Altrude, daughter of Emma of Hauteville and Odo the Good Marquis, he had a son, Roger of Salerno, who was the regent of the Principality of Antioch. His daughter Maria married Joscelin I, Count of Edessa\n", "index": [[85, 106], [133, 146], [165, 181], [249, 274], [325, 332], [390, 405], [410, 427], [563, 582], [587, 594], [603, 616], [701, 707], [801, 813], [852, 864], [908, 923], [1032, 1040], [1045, 1052], [1144, 1162], [1251, 1270], [1336, 1352], [1430, 1441], [1449, 1467], [1543, 1557], [1648, 1654], [1978, 1993], [2217, 2223], [2319, 2337], [2342, 2362], [2378, 2394], [2422, 2445], [2474, 2501]], "wikipedia_ids": [25783730, 106128, 255790, 4333752, 18011, 157902, 157904, 157674, 1127415, 106128, 803, 157653, 23275478, 2134878, 3415, 13275, 1613, 398093, 1119248, 1308260, 16230308, 5646, 285454, 750464, 2731392, 18097500, 33710749, 1210109, 256387, 296046], "wikipedia_titles": ["Richard of Hauteville", "First Crusade", "County of Edessa", "William of the Principate", "Lombards", "Robert Guiscard", "Roger I of Sicily", "Bohemond I of Antioch", "Tancred, Prince of Galilee", "First Crusade", "Arabic", "Anna Komnene", "Adriatic Sea", "Byzantine navy", "Bulgaria", "Hungary", "Alexios I Komnenos", "Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)", "Siege of Antioch", "Danishmendids", "Battle of Melitene", "Constantinople", "Edessa", "Treaty of Devol", "Marash", "Emma of Hauteville", "Odo the Good Marquis", "Roger of Salerno", "Principality of Antioch", "Joscelin I, Count of Edessa"]}

It is prepared by reaction of the polysaccharide with epichlorohydrin.  Ficoll is a registered trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies.\n\nFicoll is part of Ficoll-Paque which is used in biology laboratories to separate blood to its components (s, s etc). Ficoll-Paque is normally placed at the bottom of a conical tube, and blood is then slowly layered above Ficoll-Paque. After being centrifuged, the following layers will be visible in the conical tube, from top to bottom: plasma and other constituents, a layer of mono-nuclear cells called buffy coat (/MNC), Ficoll-Paque, and erythrocytes &  which should be present in pellet form. This separation allows easy harvest of PBMC's. Note that some red blood cell trapping (presence of erythrocytes & granulocytes) may occur in the PBMC or Ficoll-Paque layer. Major  may sometimes occur in the PBMC layer. Ethylene diamine tetra-acetate () and heparin are commonly used in conjunction with Ficoll-Paque(TM) to prevent clotting.\n\nAt one time, fairly early in the research for diabetes treatment by transplantation, Ficoll was used in an attempt to separate islets of Langerhans from enzyme (collagenase) digested human pancreatic tissue.  The theory was that separated islets could then be used for transplantation into patients with . In practice, using Ficoll led to  difficulty obtaining a pure enough preparation of islets, with enough islet recovery from the original tissue, for safe and effective islet transplantation in humans.\n\nBecause Ficoll-Paque layering is a very slow process, devices that aid in the most time-consuming step, the overlay, have been developed. One such a product is SepMate-50, a specialized tube containing a porous insert that forms a physical barrier between the Ficoll-Paque and blood sample. This allows the blood sample to be rapidly pipetted onto the insert, avoiding the need for overlaying it directly onto Ficoll-Paque. The SepMate insert also reduces the duration of the centrifugation step, and after centrifugation, the top layer containing plasma and PBMCs can be poured into a new tube.

In 1648 the Royalists and the Covenanters were defeated at the Battle of Preston, and Charles was executed in January 1649. The Scottish Covenants persuaded the exiled Charles II of England to agree to the terms of the Solemn League and Covenant in the Treaty of Breda (1650).

HKFWS focuses on social services through a family perspective that aims to enhance the well-being of families and individuals in Hong Kong. Services such as counseling are used to help reconcile issues related to family, marriage, and friendship to help prevent family breakups and other societal problems. The HKFWS now has over 30 service centers and networks helping families across Hong Kong.\n\nHKFWS's official mission statement is:\n\n\"With a family perspective, we are committed to delivering quality and professional social services to enhance the well-being of families and individuals in Hong Kong and to foster a caring community.\"\n\nHKFWS pioneers service projects to meet changing needs of the people and advocates a comprehensive public policy for needy families.\n\nThe \"Hong Kong Family Welfare Society\" was formally known as the Social Service Centre of the Churches. It was founded in 1938, but only became a public agency on January 1, 1949. The Society started out by being heavily involved with relief work after World War II. After concerns for the growth of distressed families resonated with the members, the Society further expanded its scope. Today the bulk of their work revolves around counselling families with management difficulties or communication issues. In addition, the Society focuses on preventive measures for family problems, resulting in the creation of Family Life Education in 1971. Other services like Home Help, School Social Work services, Clinical Psychological services and Foster Care came about in 1971, 1979 and 1984 respectively.\n\nHKFWS services include:\n\n# Family resource centre in Tuen Mun\n\n# 'Drop-in' services for single parents\n\n# Mental health services\n\n# Senior social work practice\n\n# Therapeutic group for abusive families\n\n# Emergency foster care\n\n# Volunteer service\n\n# Family aid services\n\n# Services for new arrivals from the Mainland\n\n# Carers support service\n\n# Peer/divorce/family mediation service\n\n# Family retreat centre\n\n# Clinical psychological service\n\n# Youth employment\n\n# Community rehabilitation and pain relief service\n\nOne programme since 1997 is the Integrated Elderly and Community Support Service to alleviate the problems associated with an .

This is vital due to the sharp increase in divorce rates in Hong Kong and the lack of communication between parents and children. Mediation is used in a bid to help salvage the family situation. It teaches individuals to reach a settlement acceptable to all parties. The Society also provides five types of services and programs namely; Special and Innovative Services, Children and Youth, Elderly and Community, Family and Child Care. The Special and Innovative Services includes programmes for employment and fund assistance.\n\nHKFWS also has a subsidiary association called the  where seminars and mediation services are available to the public.\n\nDue to the nature of the HKFWS as a , the Society relies largely on donations from the public and even the government. Important sources are the , The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, civic minded companies, charitable foundations and individual sponsorships.\n\nThe HKFWS is made up of employees and a team of volunteers. The Society is composed of the following committees:\n\nA detailed list of the structure and committee members is here:\n\nThe Society encourages individuals to become volunteers.\n\nThe function of the Corporate Volunteer Service is to link voluntary organizations and service users to volunteers. Over the years, many corporations, schools, non-profit organizations and government bodies have played their part in providing services to the HKFWS service users that consists of ethnic minorities, children, elderly, and foster care families.\n\nThe organization seeks to advocate family volunteering so that family members will share experiences thus producing solidarity.\n\nAt present, the revamped services operated by the Society includes five Integrated Family Service Centres, eight Integrated Home Care Teams (in 15 centres), one Integrated Children and Youth Service Centre and one Neighbourhood Elderly Centre.\n\nThe HKFWS and its branches have participated in campaigns co-organized by Ho-Sum that has allowed members to interact with the elderly, handicapped, young children, youths and volunteers. These campaigns are aimed at building relationships between family units and the Hong Kong society.\n\nTo provide short-term financial assistance to children from families in need so that they can enjoy proper care, full development and have growth in physical, psychological, social and learning aspects.\n\nMore information:\n\nThe Society has a strong commitment to research.

Nelsonic became notable during the early mid-1980s for being the first electronics company in the United States to produce game-watches (multi-purpose electronic devices capable of functioning as both a time-piece and as a typically electronic game). For a period subsequent to its purchase by M.Z. Berger, Nelsonic operated as a subsidiary division of its parent company and game-watches were produced that bore the Nelsonic mark. This practice ended as M.Z. Berger shifted focus to more traditional and higher-end timepieces.

These simple video games were variations on the theme of the Calculator watch, and the patent covering the Game Watch line is in fact classified as an \"electronic calculator watch structure.\" Becoming the first electronics manufacturer in the United States to produce game-watches, Nelsonic earned a large share in this specialized market and was able to earn the attention of large video game companies at events such as the . Having caught the popular attention and with goodwill at a high-point, Nelsonic was able to obtain licensing from several big-name video game companies such as Sega, Nintendo, Midway Games, and Mylstar Electronics. With roots in the toy market, Nelsonic was also able to obtain similar licenses to produce LCD versions of popular electronic toys like Milton Bradley's Simon as well as to produce original LCD games for non-game toy franchises like Barbie, G.I. Joe, and Power Rangers and even for film and TV franchises such as Ghostbusters. So well-known became the Nelsonic brand that it was even able to license its own original games (such as the Nelsonic version of the public-domain blackjack which was licensed to Caesars Palace).\n\nAs time progressed, Nelsonic experimented with higher-end products such as metal watches and increasingly complex game-watch designs. In 1990 the watch-making giant, M.Z. Berger, made a large bid and was able to successfully purchase the company. For a period of nearly a decade after this acquisition, M.Z. Berger continued to use Nelsonic as a subsidiary branch and to employ the Nelsonic mark in the release of game-watches and the production of new re-releases of popular models from the 1980s and early 1990s. By the end of the 1990s, however, public interest had waned (quite possibly due to the rise in popularity of more advanced s and, eventually, of other portable computing devices, such as s and ) and this practice came to an end as M.Z. Berger shifted markets to target higher end consumers more exclusively.\n\nToday the Nelsonic mark is still in use for traditional watches and is not used in connection with game-watches. It is still a subsidiary of M.Z. Berger and as recently as 2007 it was listed by the \n", "index": [[109, 122], [401, 407], [413, 425], [427, 432], [1678, 1694], [2205, 2209], [2211, 2219], [2221, 2233], [2396, 2410], [2413, 2418], [2493, 2499], [2501, 2509], [2515, 2528], [2573, 2585], [2734, 2743], [2766, 2780]], "wikipedia_ids": [645042, 164328, 205013, 81361, 2867523, 28222625, 21197, 430266, 154681, 593761, 164328, 28713688, 173486, 205013, 3981, 48729052], "wikipedia_titles": ["New York City", "Barbie", "Ghostbusters", "Mario", "Calculator watch", "Sega", "Nintendo", "Midway Games", "Milton Bradley Company", "Simon (game)", "Barbie", "G.I.

He returned to the starting line-up in place of Clem Rigg for the 2\u20133 loss to Darlington on 5 January 1929 and retained his place for the next ten matches. Hooper found his first-team opportunities even more limited in the 1929\u201330 season following the signing of Billy Fairhurst from Southport.\n\nAfter making eight further league appearances for Nelson, Hooper was signed by First Division side Sheffield United.

The match was notable both for a hat-trick by Worcestershire's Charles Preece and for the county's desperate but ultimately successful struggle for a draw, having been reduced to 48/8 in their second innings when stumps were drawn.\n\nHe also went wicketless in his second match, but took 2-7 in the second innings of his third. Wilson played a full part in the 1924 County Championship campaign, playing in 20 of Worcestershire's 24 games as well as one against the touring  and finishing with 38 wickets at an average of a little under 24 runs apiece. The following summer brought him his first five-wicket haul: 5-67 against Hampshire in August; and 44 wickets in all.\n\nBy some way Wilson's most successful season was his last, 1926. He took 68 first-class wickets in total, and five or more in an innings on seven occasions, this latter figure being second only to Fred Root in the Worcestershire side that year. In the space of one August week he took five wickets in each innings - his only ten-wicket match haul - against Derbyshire on his home ground at Kidderminster, then claimed his best innings figures of 8-81 in a drawn game against Somerset at Weston-super-Mare.\n\nWilson played his final match in early September 1926 against Middlesex, but bad weather meant that little play was possible and he did not take a wicket. He died in Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne\n", "index": [[59, 66], [115, 135], [166, 177], [225, 230], [237, 251], [262, 275], [293, 304], [335, 347], [351, 360], [375, 386], [501, 510], [531, 545], [833, 852], [978, 985], [1020, 1040], [1094, 1103], [1197, 1201], [1335, 1344], [1495, 1505], [1613, 1621], [1625, 1642], [1707, 1716], [1811, 1818], [1820, 1839]], "wikipedia_ids": [9316, 2763296, 678695, 2298801, 1156428, 39102, 11040, 667292, 2641030, 7611731, 411541, 18110950, 683599, 875871, 5671925, 1919370, 7620860, 1174056, 1829984, 1622178, 330072, 822103, 2391822, 70348], "wikipedia_titles": ["England", "George Alfred Wilson", "Fast bowling", "Batting order (cricket)", "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "Kidderminster", "First-class cricket", "Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "Edgbaston Cricket Ground", "1924 English cricket season", "Hat-trick", "Charles Preece", "County Championship", "Bowling average", "1925 English cricket season", "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "1926 English cricket season", "Fred Root", "Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "Somerset County Cricket Club", "Weston-super-Mare", "Middlesex County Cricket Club", "Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne", "Newcastle upon Tyne"]}

It was intended for entry into the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition, but was wrecked in a crash before the start of the competition.\n\nIn December 1911 the British War Office announced a competition for a Military aeroplane capable of carrying a pilot and observer for the recently established Royal Flying Corps. First prize was \u00a34,000, with the War Office having the option to purchase any of the prize winning machines.\n\nThe American showman and aviation pioneer Samuel Cody, who had developed a system of man-carrying kites from 1901, built his first aircraft, the British Army Aeroplane No 1 at the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough in 1908, making its first flight, recognised as the first powered controlled flight in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1908.  In order to compete for the prize money offered by the War Office, Cody decided to design and build a new monoplane, while also entering his existing biplane that had finished fourth in the 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race.\n\nCody's previous designs were pusher canard biplanes, but the new aircraft was a tractor high-winged monoplane powered by a single 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) Austro-Daimler engine which had been fitted to an Etrich Taube which had crashed during the 1911 Circuit of Britain, which Cody had purchased after the race. It had a deep fuselage that accommodated the crew of two side-by-side. The tail arrangement was unusual, with two elevators  and two rudders carried on four bamboo booms that led back from the fuselage, the all moving tail surfaces forming a box shape. Fabric was stretched between the tail booms giving a cruciform shape as seen in cross-section. Lateral control was by means of wing warping, and the aircraft was fitted with a nosewheel undercarriage.\n\nThe monoplane made its maiden flight on 21 June 1912, but on 8 July a cow ran into the path of the aircraft during landing.  The resulting crash badly damaged the aircraft and killed the cow, although Cody was not badly injured. As the Circuit of Britain aircraft had already been wrecked in a crash, Cody used the engine from the monoplane together with what parts he could salvage from the biplane to construct a new aircraft, the Cody V biplane\n", "index": [[43, 52], [164, 207], [303, 313], [433, 451], [708, 735], [743, 763], [767, 778], [1012, 1021], [1056, 1063], [1101, 1139], [1171, 1177], [1178, 1184], [1185, 1192], [1222, 1229], [1297, 1311], [1347, 1359], [1569, 1578], [1612, 1618], [1835, 1847], [1884, 1907], [2343, 2357]], "wikipedia_ids": [75127, 32897971, 274472, 233670, 12386543, 250131, 232477, 75127, 36040686, 19104883, 1026521, 9214592, 49201, 1028296, 12101901, 603400, 950992, 39029, 1647947, 1052884, 27040074], "wikipedia_titles": ["Monoplane", "1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition", "War Office", "Royal Flying Corps", "British Army Aeroplane No 1", "Royal Aircraft Establishment", "Farnborough, Hampshire", "Monoplane", "Cody Circuit of Britain biplane", "Daily Mail Circuit of Britain air race", "Pusher configuration", "Canard (aeronautics)", "Biplane", "Tractor configuration", "Austro-Daimler 6", "Etrich Taube", "Elevator (aeronautics)", "Bamboo", "Wing warping", "Tricycle landing gear", "Cody V biplane"]}

He is credited with having designed the city with the help of three local architects. It is based on three parallel streets, interconnected by a series of narrower streets at right angles, thus producing a grid pattern, providing s to the three piazzas, each with their own church, the largest having a cathedral.

Later the architects Giovanni Battista Vaccarini, and Rosario Gagliardi designed many buildings in the city.\n\nLandolina rule was broken in 1730 when his son Francesco Landolina, Marchese di S.

Originally the Lincoln Highway was routed along a single lane  and rock wall built in 1863. Recognizing the inadequacy of the single lane road, efforts began to improve capacity on the primary road to Lake Tahoe.  The first bore was constructed in 1931, as part of a reconstruction of a  section of the Lincoln Highway.

Construction on the second bore began in 1957, when US&nbsp;50 was widened to four lanes, at a cost of just over $450,000 (equivalent to  $ million today). Coincidentally, both bores were constructed by Utah based construction companies.\n\nThe Cave Rock area is considered sacred by the Washoe tribe. The Washoe tribal leaders were not consulted about the construction of either bore, and were upset about the perceived desecration of their tribal lands.

After 1886, the boundaries of the district never changed; the Iowa General Assembly refused to reapportion its districts until the loss of two seats following the 1930 census left the State with no other choice.\n\nThe district was predominantly rural, especially in its 1886 reconfiguration.  During that period, it included only one of Iowa's twenty largest cities \u2014 Fort Dodge \u2014 and included counties that had been relatively slow to settle.  However, by 1895 the large area of the 10th District, coupled with increased migration to its small towns, caused it to have the largest population of any of Iowa's congressional districts. By 1890, the continued disproportionate increase in the population of the 10th and 11th Districts caused some to predict that the General Assembly would need to reduce the area of each district, but no such change occurred.  By 1921, the 10th District had over 100,000 more residents than the 1st District, and nearly 60,000 more than the population of an ideally-sized Iowa congressional district.\n\nEvery congressman elected from this district was a member of the Republican Party. As a general matter, the most influential event during each election year was not the November general election, but the Republican Party's district nominating convention (or later, the Republican primary). Two 10th district congressmen (Jonathan P. Dolliver and ) became well-known members of the U.S. Senate and sought national office.\n\nUnder the nine-district plan adopted by the Iowa General Assembly in 1931, the boundaries of the old 10th district were preserved as the new 8th district. The last congressman elected by the old 10th district, Fred C. Gilchrist, was elected in the new 8th district in 1932. Ten years later, when the 1940 census caused Iowa to lose another seat, the new 6th district included all of the old 10th district's counties, plus Wright County.  It was only after that district elected a Democrat (Merwin Coad\n", "index": [[67, 71], [103, 141], [304, 309], [311, 322], [324, 332], [334, 340], [342, 347], [349, 355], [357, 365], [367, 375], [377, 384], [386, 393], [395, 404], [406, 413], [419, 424], [647, 654], [656, 663], [665, 673], [675, 680], [682, 688], [719, 728], [730, 740], [837, 858], [1142, 1152], [1492, 1496], [1874, 1890], [2130, 2150], [2441, 2458], [2721, 2732]], "wikipedia_ids": [26810748, 19468510, 95903, 96023, 96003, 95995, 95939, 95902, 95998, 95991, 95996, 95981, 95906, 95907, 96032, 96027, 96026, 96015, 96006, 96001, 95962, 95960, 1213502, 114334, 22384888, 32070, 350053, 11585581, 11585696], "wikipedia_titles": ["Iowa", "United States House of Representatives", "Worth County, Iowa", "Cerro Gordo County, Iowa", "Franklin County, Iowa", "Hardin County, Iowa", "Story County, Iowa", "Wright County, Iowa", "Hamilton County, Iowa", "Humboldt County, Iowa", "Hancock County, Iowa", "Kossuth County, Iowa", "Winnebago County, Iowa", "Webster County, Iowa", "Boone County, Iowa", "Calhoun County, Iowa", "Carroll County, Iowa", "Crawford County, Iowa", "Emmet County, Iowa", "Greene County, Iowa", "Palo Alto County, Iowa", "Pocahontas County, Iowa", "Iowa General Assembly", "Fort Dodge, Iowa", "Iowa's 11th congressional district", "Republican Party (United States)", "Jonathan P.

{"id": "Maxwell_Hunter", "bracket": "0.9-1.0", "text": "Maxwell White Hunter II (March 11, 1922 \u2013 November 10, 2001) was a prominent American aerospace engineer. He worked on the design of the Douglas B-42 and B-43 bombers, the Honest John, Nike-Ajax, and Nike-Zeus missiles, the Thor IRBM, and on parts of the Strategic Defense Initiative.\n\nIn later years he worked on space-launch vehicles and was a proponent of Single-Stage-to-Orbit (SSTO) designs. He was honored in 1995 by the National Space Society for lifelong contributions to the technology of spaceflight.\n\nMaxwell Hunter was born in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania and graduated from  in that state with a degree in physics and mathematics. In 1944, he earned a Master's Degree in aeronautical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nAfter earning his MS from MIT, Hunter went to work for the Douglas Aircraft Company. He became their chief designer in aeronautics, working on modifications of the B-42 and B-43 bombers. Later he was promoted to chief engineer for space systems. In this position he oversaw the production of military missiles including the Honest John artillery rocket, the Nike antiaircraft missile, and the Sparrow air-to-air missile.\n\nDouglas Aircraft began work on the Thor, an early  (IRBM), in late 1955 and put Hunter in charge of that program. He assembled a small team of crack designers and brought the development to success in a short time. Thor became the basis of the McDonnell Douglas , whose descendants are still boosting payloads into Earth orbit today.\n\nAfter working for Douglas Aircraft from 1944 to 1961, Hunter joined the staff of the , a group that advised the U.S. president on space policy. Following several years in that position, he went back to the aerospace industry in 1965, spending over two decades with Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (LMSC). (LMSC was a division of Lockheed Corporation, which merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to become .)\n\nAt LMSC, Hunter worked on a variety of projects including parts of the mammoth Strategic Defense Initiative. SDI gave him a chance at realizing a dream he had nurtured since the 1960s: the construction of a Single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle. In 1984, Hunter proposed a vehicle he called the X-rocket, based on those earlier SSTO designs. The design was reviewed by LMSC's Astronautics Division (AD), which judged it worth pursuing, and by its Missile Systems Division (MSD), which did not.\n\nLMSC then declined to support further work on the X-rocket, and Hunter retired. As an independent consultant, he renamed the concept SSX (for Space Ship Experimental), and began to refine it. In December 1988 the ad hoc  was briefed on the concept by Hunter and others. The general concept was endorsed by the Council and by High Frontier, Inc., a Washington-based group headed by Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham that lobbied for SDI programs. Working together, Hunter and High Frontier convinced SDI management and other national officials that a study should be initiated to determine once and for all the feasibility of SSTO vehicles for military missions.\n\nThis led to a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) program to design a single-stage vehicle that could replace military satellites on short notice during a national emergency. This vehicle was known as the Delta Clipper. McDonnell Douglas Corporation was contracted to build and test fly a one-third-scale, suborbital testbed called the DC-X, or Delta Clipper Experimental. While not capable of spaceflight, the DC-X incorporated many of the technologies needed for an SSTO vehicle, including highly automated systems enabling a quick turnaround (just twenty-six hours) between launches. It made eight successful test flights between August 18, 1993, and July 7, 1995, and then was taken over by NASA and flown four times as the DC-XA between May 18 and July 31, 1996. It was damaged on its last flight when one landing strut failed to deploy and the vehicle tipped over at landing. Funding to make repairs and continue flight tests was not made available.\n\nMax Hunter continued to advise on space policy issues and advocate the building of SSTO vehicles for airline-like access to space, a goal he was sure could be attained. He chaired the Rules Committee for the Ansari X Prize, announced in 1996, a $10 million prize for the first reusable craft to reach space twice within two weeks without substantial refit. In October 2000, he agreed to serve as Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Undersea Hotel Project of the Cala Corporation. He died at Stanford Hospital, Stanford, California on the evening of November 10, 2001 after a lingering illness.\n\nMax Hunter was Phi Beta Kappa, Tau Beta Pi, and a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Astronautical Society (AAS), and the British Interplanetary Society (BIS). He was also a member of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and an honorary member of the .

Along with contemporary haridasa saints such as Gopala Dasa, Helevankatte Giriamma, Jagannatha Dasa and Prasanna Venkata Dasa, he propagated the virtues of the philosophy of  across South India through devotional songs called devaranama written in the Kannada language. An integral part of Kannada  devotional literature, these compositions in praise of the Hindu god Vishnu are called dasara padagalu (compositions of the dasas). These compositions can be more specifically categorized as keertanas, suladis,ugabhogas, and simply padas. They were easy to sing to the accompaniment of a musical instrument and dealt with bhakti (devotion) and the virtues of a pious life.\n\nVijaya Dasa was born in a poor Brahmin family in Cheekalaparvi in Manvi taluk of Raichur district, Karnataka state. His parents were Sri Srinivasappa and Kusamma. He left home at a young age and studied Sanskrit in Varanasi for four years. Later when his marriage was troubled by poverty, he went back to Varanasi where he became a scholar.  One night, he had a dream in which the 16th century Carnatic composer and wandering saint Purandara Dasa initiated him into the Haridasa tradition and gave him the  (ankita nama) Vijaya Vittala.  From that day he was called Vijaya Dasa (dasa lit, slave to God), and dedicated his life to spreading Dvaita teachings.\n\nHis 25,000 extant compositions earned him the title Dasa Shresta (noble among the dasas). His compositions which comprise of use of many Sanskrit words come under the category of Kalasha and Urasu creations and are considered an important component of Kannada literature (Kannada Sahitya). His purported miracles include calming the Ganges, entering it without getting wet, preventing a woman from committing suicide, resurrecting his son, and making a uneducated man speak difficult Sanskrit proficiently.

This culture takes its name from the Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. Marksville Culture was contemporaneous with the Hopewell cultures of Ohio and Illinois. It evolved from the earlier  and into the Baytown and Troyville cultures and later the Coles Creek and Plum Bayou cultures. It is considered ancestral to the Natchez and Taensa Peoples.\n\nThe Hopewell tradition was a widely dispersed set of related populations, which were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the . The Marksville culture was a southern manifestation of this network. Settlements were large and usually located on terraces of major streams. Evidence from excavations of burial mounds from this period suggest they were constructed for persons of high social status, and contained grave goods of imported exotic materials such as copper panpipes, earspools, bracelets and beads, rare minerals, stone platform pipes, mica figurines, marine shells, freshwater pearls, and greenstone celts. The pipes had flat bases with a hole for a stem, and a bowl in the center. Animal figurines on the platform aren't unusual, with the bowl being located in the animal's back. The high status leaders organized community life, and officiated at burial ceremonies, an important part of the Marksville Culture. The mounds were constructed in stages over many years, with the first stage being a flat, low platform. The ceremonies may have been held years apart and those who died between ceremonies were temporarily stored in other locations, then gathered up and buried together.\n\nAlthough made from local clay, Marksville pottery was similar in design and decoration to pottery found in Illinois and Ohio. A typical vessel was three to five inches tall and three to seven inches in diameter and often decorated with geometric and effigy designs, usually stylized birds. This decorated pottery was made primarily for ceremonial uses, with other plainer utilitarian ware for daily use. Marksville pottery influenced Santa Rosa pottery, a defining character of the contemporary Santa Rosa-Swift Creek culture, located to the east of the Marksville culture area along the Gulf coast.\n\nThe Marksville culture was preceded by the , and was eventually succeeded by the Troyville culture in southeastern and eastern Louisiana and western Mississippi and Baytown culture\n", "index": [[31, 53], [77, 82], [95, 101], [118, 127], [129, 140], [142, 150], [152, 160], [211, 221], [289, 323], [327, 354], [404, 421], [425, 429], [434, 442], [486, 493], [498, 515], [531, 542], [547, 557], [602, 609], [614, 620], [1108, 1114], [1194, 1198], [1248, 1258], [2338, 2368], [2525, 2542], [2609, 2624]], "wikipedia_ids": [642871, 296815, 1785256, 18130, 16949861, 19571, 1930, 36530, 15511127, 97715, 313110, 22199, 14849, 19442337, 33491589, 19250964, 33224238, 1537516, 3799783, 125293, 21061, 13766386, 22148459, 33491589, 19442337], "wikipedia_titles": ["Archaeological culture", "Yazoo River", "Tensas River", "Louisiana", "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Arkansas", "Mobile Bay", "Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site", "Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana", "Hopewell tradition", "Ohio", "Illinois", "Baytown culture", "Troyville culture", "Coles Creek culture", "Plum Bayou culture", "Natchez people", "Taensa", "Copper", "Mica", "Greenstone (archaeology)", "Santa Rosa\u2013Swift Creek culture", "Troyville culture", "Baytown culture"]}

Marillier moved across to the first and third balls he received from McGrath and flicked them over his shoulder to fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by one run. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes made him famous, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.\n\nMarillier continued to do reasonably well for the national side.

All living members of the House of Wittelsbach descend from Palatinate-Birkenfeld, which thus became the parent branch of the Kings of Bavaria.\n\nThe patriarch of the line was . He was a son of Duke , who when he died in 1569, bequeathed the Palatine share of the Rear County of Sponheim to his son Karl. The latter chose Birkenfeld as his residence and in 1595, through the Treaty of Kastellaun with his joint ruler the Margrave of , Edward Fortunatus, secured exclusive rule in the districts of Birkenfeld and Allenbach (until 1671). Under him, Birkenfeld Castle underwent major expansion. Following Karl's death in 1600, he was succeeded by , who ruled until 1669. He was succeeded by , who however died in 1671.

After Christian's death his nephew  became ruler. Under his rule, the Rear County of Sponheim was finally partitioned. It was agreed that of the two joint rulers, the Margrave of Baden was to make the division and then the Count Palatine by Rhine was to choose his share. Possibly the hope on the Baden side was that Karl III August would decide on the portion in which Birkenfeld and the family seat were located; nonetheless, Karl III August decided upon the Mosel region around , so that after 1776 the Birkenfeld region became the exclusive possession of Baden. His brother Maximilian I Joseph succeeded him after his death in 1795.

It passes through  and Nashville, where there is a junction with M-66. The entire highway is undivided surface road. It has no direct access with Interstate 69 (I-69), although a sign for the highway is located on southbound I-69 at exit 61.\n\nThe highway was first designated in 1919 between Hastings and Battle Creek. It was later moved to run to Charlotte. A section of M-79 was designated as M-214 in the 1930s. M-214 would later be decommissioned as a highway designation and the M-79 designation was reapplied to the roadway.\n\nM-79 starts south of Hastings at a three-way intersection with M-37 in . The trunkline runs east and parallel to a section of the Thornapple River through wooded terrain that is interspersed with farm fields. South of Thornapple Lake, M-79 angles southeasterly moving from Quimby Road to Scott Road running parallel to the Thornapple River again into the community of Nashville. M-79 meets M-66 and turns south along the latter highway's route along Main and Durkee streets through the community. South of town in Maple Grove Township, M-79 separates from M-66 and turns east along Lawrence Road. Outside of Charlotte, M-79 curves southeast to transition to Lawrence Avenue through town. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with Cochran Avenue, which carries BL&nbsp;I-69 and M-50.\n\nM-79 was formed as a state trunkline by July 1, 1919 along part of its present routing. At the time, it ran between Hastings and Nashville as it does today. From Nashville, the trunkline turned south and west to end at the contemporary M-17 in Battle Creek. By 1927, the southernmost section of M-79 was truncated when M-78 was extended to Battle Creek. In late 1930, the southernmost section is shortened once again as a new M-14 designation replaced M-79 south of Nashville. An eastward extension of M-79 at the same time carries the highway designation to Vermontville.\n\nM-79 was extended easterly to Charlotte in 1934 at the same time that the section of the trunkline between Nashville and Vermontville was redesignated M-214. M-79 was rerouted along Assyria and Lawrence roads at the time to connect the sections of M-79 on either side of M-214.

The minimal storyline centers on the plucky 's efforts to rescue his girlfriend and a doglike Uncle Tom from perilous predicaments and villains. The short's stereotypical portrayal of black characters prompted United Artists to withhold it from syndication in 1968, making it one of the infamous Censored Eleven. It was the second Merrie Melodies film to be released.\n\nHittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land has a rudimentary plot, unlike most of the Merrie Melodies of the time, which barely have any plot at all. The cartoon stars the Mickey Mouse-esque , his girlfriend Fluffy, and a canine Uncle Tom. The film opens with a singing steamboat dancing down a river. On the deck, three blackface caricatures play the song for which the short is named on the harmonica, banjo, and bones. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom drives Fluffy toward the boat by donkey cart. The scene shifts to Piggy the riverboat captain in a sequence reminiscent of Disney's 1928 film Steamboat Willie. Fluffy joins the frolicking steamboat passengers and reunites with her boyfriend, but during the revelry, Piggy falls overboard. The pig has a run in with an alligator, but he makes it back to the boat. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom's donkey bucks him into a cemetery. There, in a variation on a stock gag featuring a superstitious black man, he is scared by three dancing skeletons reminiscent of those in Disney's 1929 short The Skeleton Dance. Tom escapes to the middle of the river, but a shoddy boat leaves him stranded and drowning. Piggy saves the day but not before a vaudevillian villain kidnaps his porcine paramour. Piggy captures the villain on a passing mail hook, leaving the villain tortured over a buzz saw. This short marks the second and last appearance of the characters Piggy and Fluffy.\n\nHittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land was released in American theaters on November 28, 1931 by Warner Bros.. The cartoon's copyright expired in 1965, making it go into public domain. However, the cartoon has been withheld from distribution since 1968. At that time, United Artists owned the rights to most Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah land and ten other cartoons were deemed to feature racist depictions of African Americans that were too integral to the films for simple cuts to make them palatable for modern audiences. The cartoon has never been released on laserdisc, home video, or DVD.

It is  in length, including  of the exit ramp to the merge with westbound I-84.\n\nI-691 is also known as the Henry D. Altobello Highway for its entire length.\n\nI-691 is the main east\u2013west highway of the city of Meriden. The freeway actually begins in Middlefield as Route 66, technically becoming I-691 at the junction with I-91 (Exit 11). However, westbound signage indicates I-691 begins at the start of the freeway (just west of Exit 13), while eastbound signage shows I-691 ending at the Route 15 interchange (at eastbound Exit 10 about  west of the interchange with I-91). To go from I-91 northbound to I-691 westbound (or from I-691 eastbound to I-91 southbound), one must actually use Route 15.\n\nIn the 1940s, the I-691 routing was part of a planned US 6A Expressway from Southington to Willimantic. A section of the expressway (from its Middlefield terminus west to Exit 8) first opened in 1966. By 1968, the US 6A designation was dropped in favor of Route 66. The highway was extended west to Exit 4 by 1971. The connection to I-84 was eventually completed in 1987, with the renumbering to I-691 done at the same time. The portion east of I-91 remained as Route 66.

He played his debut game for Derbyshire against Leicestershire in August 1934, which was his only game in the 1934 season when he scored 7 and 0. He played six games in the 1935 season without distinction, often being denied the chance to play a second innings and during Derbyshire's Championship-winning 1936 season he played only twice. He appeared in three games in the 1937 season but in the 1938 season came to the fore playing more matches and hitting two half-centuries. In the 1939 season he played a fuller season and made his top score of 142 not out against Somerset.\n\nTownsend went to South Africa during the war and played one first-class match against a team of South Africans, playing for an Air Force XI. He played for a Derbyshire team in 1945 and when the championship restarted in the 1946 season he became a first-choice batsman. Against Warwickshire, he scored 105 against the economical, penetrating bowling of Test player Eric Hollies. During in the 1947 season, Townsend scored 137 against Yorkshire and 102 against Surrey and managed eight half-centuries, and was the most successful Derbyshire batsman during the season. In the 1948 season, he scored 102 not out against Lancashire. In the 1949 season he sustained an eye injury when fielding at short leg and this seriously affected his ability to focus. As a result he played fewer games in 1949 and in 1950 played only twice before ending his first class career. In his last three years he was also playing for Derbyshire second XI in the minor counties competition.\n\nTownsend was a right-handed batsman and played 200 innings in 117 first class matches with an average of 23.13 and a top score of 142 not out. He bowled 11 overs without taking a wicket. Wisden described him as \"the epitome of [Derbyshire's] patient watchful batting\".\n\nTownsend died in Derby at the age of 81.

Burgoyne, who took the Spanish base at Valencia de Alc\u00e1ntara two months earlier then marched against forces preparing to cross the River Tagus into Alentejo.\n\nOn the 3rd October 1762  in anticipation of a Spanish offensive across the Z\u00eazere River against the Portuguese headquarters at Abrantes instructed George Townshend to march to the  country, marching along the left bank of the Z\u00eazere river, to make a junction with Lord George Lennox's forces and to threaten the Spanish lines of communication with Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo by advancing on Belmonte and . This new march was promptly executed and Townshend's Portuguese soldiers enduring the greatest privations; but his men successfully attacked a French force escorting a convoy near , capturing a large quantity of supplies.\n\nThe same day, the Spanish force, who had taken Vila Velha on the 2nd, advanced on , leaving behind eight artillery pieces guarded by 200 grenadiers and 100 horse. General Burgoyne, who was in charge of the defence of the south bank of the Tagus in this area, noticed that only a small force was guarding the Spanish battery at Vila Velha and ordered lieutenant-colonel Charles Lee to take the head of a detachment (100 Portuguese grenadiers, 200 men of the  and 50 men of the ), to pass the Tagus and to attack this position. A Portuguese grenadier of the 2nd Cascais Infantry courageously crossed the Tagus with a rope to facilitate the passage of a barge, sacrificing his life in this action.\n\nOn 7 October, Lee's detachment, using surprise, launched a night attack and surprised the Spanish camp at Vila Velha. Although they were entrenched surprise helped the British and Portuguese to manage to overpower and disperse the Spanish horse and foot inflicting considerable loss. As well as 250 Spanish killed wounded or captured, 6 guns and 60 artillery mules were acquired. Lee's main target however was the artillery depot and this was mostly burned, some of it being taken.

He was a second-team All-Badger Conference pick as a senior and by the end of his career was the all-time assists leader at Oregon for a career (458), season (201) and single game (20).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Smart attended Kenyon College, a liberal arts school in Ohio. On the ESPN program Pardon the Interruption, Smart credited his personal relationship with then head coach Bill Brown as the reason for his decision. As a member of the Kenyon College basketball team, he was an all-conference selection as a senior and is the school's career assists leader (542).

The Rams' selection into the tournament was widely criticized. His coaching strategy, positive outlook, and patience helped VCU defeat USC in the First Four, and then upset the 6th-seeded Georgetown Hoyas and 3rd-seeded Purdue Boilermakers to advance to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history. VCU won 72\u201371 against Florida State University in overtime to earn the school's first spot in the Elite Eight and subsequently upset the top-seeded University of Kansas 71\u201361 for its first Final Four appearance.

The name Chetco comes from the word meaning \"close to the mouth of the stream\" in their own language, which is part of the Athapascan languages. Although they were once one of the largest tribes on the Pacific coast of Oregon, \"the last known full-blooded Chetco\" died in 1940, and as of 2009 only 40 or so descendants of the tribe remain. Some Chetco people are enrolled in  Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria, located in Humboldt County, California, and Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians in Oregon.\n\nThe Chetco language is a member of the Athapascan languages, which also includes most native languages in Alaska, the  and Navajo languages in the southwest United States, and the languages spoken by the  and  tribes in Oregon. The name Chetco comes from the word Cheti in their own language, meaning \"close to the mouth of the stream\". The nine villages of the tribe on the Chetco River were named Chettanne, Chettannene (twin villages at the mouth of the river), Khuniliikhwut, Nakwutthume, Nukhwuchutun, Setthatun, Siskhaslitun, Tachukhaslitun, and Thlcharghilitun.\n\nThe Chetco are believed to have come to coastal Oregon between 3000 and 1000 years ago.  They had nine villages on the lower  of the Chetco River, with their principal villages at the mouth, where the river flows into the Pacific Ocean. The Chetco territory extended a short distance on either side of the river, along the Pacific coast from  in the north to the Winchuck River in the south. They were the most populous of the 12 coastal tribes in southern Oregon.\n\nThe Chetco were hunter-gatherers with a diet based on hunting deer and elk, gathering acorns and mussels, and fishing. They used dugout canoes on the ocean and river and worked with stone tools. The Chetco cooked on open fires or with simple pots, and were culturally very similar to the  tribe to the south, \"who shared the same customs regulating social relationships and frequently intermarried\".\n\nThe tribe is thought to have had perhaps one thousand members at its peak, but its numbers declined after European-American settlers came into contact with the Chetco in the 19th century. Settlers destroyed the Chetco villages in 1853 and the surviving members of the tribe were forcibly removed to the Siletz Reservation in Tillamook County, Oregon (in 1879 the land the reservation is on became part of Lincoln County\n", "index": [[12, 25], [69, 85], [123, 135], [139, 151], [159, 169], [173, 179], [304, 324], [557, 615], [628, 655], [661, 698], [715, 730], [750, 770], [817, 823], [834, 849], [1503, 1516], [1644, 1658], [1763, 1778], [1833, 1838], [1844, 1850], [1876, 1889], [2451, 2469], [2473, 2497], [2553, 2567]], "wikipedia_ids": [4033483, 21217, 708307, 92029, 18618239, 26811621, 337846, 36250480, 80544, 4548581, 4033483, 337846, 624, 176526, 23070, 31501230, 210098, 922939, 144156, 490476, 327207, 91996, 92004], "wikipedia_titles": ["Tolowa language", "Native Americans in the United States", "Chetco River", "Curry County, Oregon", "U.S. state", "Oregon", "Athabaskan languages", "Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria", "Humboldt County, California", "Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians", "Tolowa language", "Athabaskan languages", "Alaska", "Navajo language", "Pacific Ocean", "Winchuck River", "Hunter-gatherer", "Acorn", "Mussel", "Dugout canoe", "Siletz Reservation", "Tillamook County, Oregon", "Lincoln County, Oregon"]}
{"id": "Jackie_Tyrrell", "bracket": "0.6-0.7", "text": "Jackie Tyrrell (born 19 June 1982) is an Irish hurler who plays as a left corner-back for the Kilkenny senior team.  He joined the team during the  and became a regular member of the starting fifteen over subsequent seasons.\n\nTyrrell is regarded as one of the lynchpins of the Kilkenny defence. He has won six All-Ireland winners' medals, seven Leinster winners' medals and four National League winners' medal. The All-Ireland-winning captain of 2006, he has ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion.\n\nAt club level Tyrrell is an All-Ireland medalist with James Stephens. In addition to this he has also won two Leinster medals, three county hurling championship medals and two county football championship medals.\n\nJackie Tyrrell was born in Kilkenny in 1982.  He received his primary education locally before later attending , a famed hurling nursery in the city.  It was here that Tyrrell's hurling skills were developed and nurtured by the many hurling enthusiasts there.  He won back-to-back Leinster colleges' titles in 1999 and 2000.  This latter victory was later converted into an All-Ireland colleges title after a defeat of Gort Community College.  Tyrrell later studied at the Cork Institute of Technology and at the Limerick Institute of Technology.  It was at the latter institution that he won a Fitzgibbon Cup medal on a team trained by Clare's Davy Fitzgerald.   Tyrrell won a second Fitzgibbon Cup title two years after his first in 2007.\n\n===Club===\n\nTyrrell plays his club hurling and football with the famous James Stephens club. He has had much success at under-age levels, including championship medals at under-14, under-16, under-21 and junior.\n\nIn 2003 Tyrrell won a county football championship medal following a 2-7 to 0-6 defeat of O'Loughlin Gaels.\n\nTyrrell added a county hurling championship medal to his collection in 2004 following a 2-16 to 3-12 defeat of Young Ireland's. He later collected a Leinster title, although the one-point defeat of UCD was in controversial circumstances. The James Stephens club subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final with Athenry providing the opposition.  A victory for \"the village\" gave Tyrrell a coveted All-Ireland club medal.\n\nJames Stephens retained the county championship in 2005, with Tyrrell winning a second hurling medal following a 1-18 to 2-12 defeat pf . He later picked up a second Leinster club medal following a second consecutive triumph over UCD.  James Stephens were subsequently trounced by eventual winners Portumna in the All-Ireland semi-final.\n\nAfter a six-year gap Tyrrell won a third hurling championship in 2011 after a thrilling draw and replay with Ballyhale Shamrocks.\n\nTyrrell first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kilkenny under-21 team. Success was slow in coming in this grade as Wexford dominated in the early years of the new century. In 2003 Kilkenny defeated Dublin by 0-12 to 1-4 giving Tyrrell a Leinster medal in that grade. He later lined out in the under-21 championship decider with Galway providing the opposition. Kilkenny won that game by 2-13 to 0-12 with Tyrrell collecting a coveted All-Ireland medal and collecting the cup as captain.\n\nIn 2003 Tyrrell joined the Kilkenny senior team for the first time. He was a non-playing substitute that year as 'the Cats' claimed the All-Ireland, Leister and National League titles.\n\nTyrrell made his competitive debut for Kilkenny in a National League game against Waterford in 2004. He was a regular during that league campaign, however, he played no part in the subsequent championship.\n\nKilkenny were back in form in 2005, with Tyrrell winning his first National League medal following a huge 3-20 to 0-15 victory over Clare.  Kilkenny later defeated Wexford by 0-22 to 1-16 in the provincial decider, giving Delaney a first Leinster winners' medal.  While a third successive All-Ireland showdown with Cork seemed likely, Galway defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the games of the decade.\n\nIn 2006 Tyrrell was appointed captain for the year. He added a second consecutive National League medal to his collection following a 3-11 to 0-14 victory over Limerick.  He later won his second Leinster medal following another facile victory over Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against Cork. The Leesiders were aiming for a third All-Ireland victory in-a-row; however, revenge was foremost in the minds of Kilkenny as it was Cork who denied their three-in-a-row bid in 2004. On the day Kilkenny were far too strong for Cork as 'the Cats' secured a 1-16 to 1-13 victory. It was Walsh's first All-Ireland winners' medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the  as captain.\n\nTyrrell collected a third Leinster medal in-a-row in 2007 following another facile victory in the provincial decider. Kilkenny later qualified for the All-Ireland final where, surprisingly, Limerick provided the opposition. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes and went on to win the game by 2-19 to 1-15.  It was Tyrrell's second consecutive All-Ireland medal.  He was later presented with a coveted  award.\n\n2008 saw Kilkenny launch an all-out attack in an attempt to capture a third All-Ireland title in-a-row.  Tyrrell collected a fourth Leinster winners' medal after a 5\u201321 to 0\u201317 defeat of Wexford in the provincial final, before later lining out in the All-Ireland decider. Waterford provided the opposition, however, Kilkenny recorded an enormous 3\u201330 to 1\u201313 victory. It was a third All-Ireland winners' medal for Tyrrell. A second All-Star award quickly followed.\n\nTyrrell won his third National League winners' medal in 2009 following a thrilling 4-17 to 2-26 defeat of Tipperary. A fifth Leinster medal quickly followed before Kilkenny set out to make history by becoming the second team in hurling history to win four successive All-Ireland finals. Tipperary were the opponents and, for much of the match, it looked as if they would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' the title. Two quick goals in the space of a minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2\u201322 to 0\u201323 victory. It was Tyrrell's fourth consecutive All-Ireland medal. He later won a third All-Star award.\n\nTyrrell added a sixth Leinster winners' medal to his collection in 2010 following a 1-19 to 1-12 defeat of new provincial rivals Galway. Kilkenny faced a number of injury worries going into an historic All-Ireland final, and ultimately failed in their 'drive for five' as Tipperary won by 4-17 to 1-18. In spite of the defeat Delaney later won a fourth successive All-Star award.\n\nIn 2011 'the Cats' continued their provincial dominance with Tyrrell winning a seventh consecutive Leinster winners' medal following a defeat of Dublin.  Kilkenny later qualified for a sixth consecutive All-Ireland final. For the third year in succession Tyrrell's side faced Tipperary, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2-17 to 1-16 victory.  It was Delaney's fifth All-Ireland winners' medal.\n\n2012 began well for Kilkenny. A trouncing of old rivals Cork gave Tyrrell a fourth National League winners' medal. After losing the Leinster final to GAlway, both sides subsequently met in the All-Ireland decider and Galway nearly pulled off a victory courtesy of goals from Joe Canning and Niall Burke\n", "index": [[41, 46], [47, 53], [94, 102], [310, 321], [345, 353], [379, 394], [542, 553], [568, 582], [624, 632], [647, 674], [690, 718], [755, 763], [1102, 1122], [1201, 1229], [1241, 1273], [1323, 1337], [1365, 1370], [1373, 1388], [1542, 1556], [1705, 1733], [1773, 1789], [1808, 1835], [1903, 1918], [1941, 1949], [1990, 1993], [2108, 2115], [2194, 2205], [2517, 2525], [2767, 2775], [2835, 2842], [2918, 2924], [2957, 2965], [3048, 3054], [3154, 3165], [3344, 3355], [3357, 3364], [3369, 3384], [3476, 3485], [4187, 4195], [4343, 4347], [4924, 4932], [4998, 5011], [5016, 5030], [5499, 5508], [5799, 5808], [5980, 5989], [6842, 6848], [7031, 7040], [7365, 7371], [7490, 7501], [7506, 7517]], "wikipedia_ids": [775859, 73105, 2795066, 780802, 3531363, 2802698, 3341596, 6837581, 7501228, 6932812, 7085557, 92621, 5011213, 542603, 537825, 4560007, 2794983, 5795114, 6837581, 7085557, 23079478, 6932812, 69869310, 7501228, 7065111, 25648606, 3341596, 16715841, 2795066, 2810897, 2759665, 6195780, 2810853, 6141965, 780802, 3531363, 2802698, 2802645, 2810846, 32532531, 2810846, 5575719, 5287742, 2802645, 2802637, 2802637, 2759665, 1170065, 2810853, 12949356, 35139982], "wikipedia_titles": ["Irish people", "Hurling", "Kilkenny GAA", "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship", "Leinster Senior Hurling Championship", "National Hurling League", "All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship", "James Stephens GAA", "Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship", "Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship", "Kilkenny Senior Football Championship", "Kilkenny", "Dr Croke Cup", "Cork Institute of Technology", "Limerick Institute of Technology", "Fitzgibbon Cup", "Clare GAA", "Davy Fitzgerald", "James Stephens GAA", "Kilkenny Senior Football Championship", "O'Loughlin Gaels GAA", "Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship", "Young Irelands GAA", "Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship", "UCD GAA", "Athenry GAA", "All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship", "Portumna GAA", "Kilkenny GAA", "Wexford GAA", "Dublin GAA", "Leinster Under-20 Hurling Championship", "Galway GAA", "All-Ireland Under-20 Hurling Championship", "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship", "Leinster Senior Hurling Championship", "National Hurling League", "Waterford GAA", "Limerick GAA", "Cork GAA", "Limerick GAA", "Eddie Brennan", "Henry Shefflin", "Waterford GAA", "Tipperary GAA", "Tipperary GAA", "Dublin GAA", "Underdog", "Galway GAA", "Joe Canning", "Niall Burke"]}

He was born in , Yorkshire and died at Stroud, Gloucestershire.\n\nA right-handed tail-end batsman and wicketkeeper, Rochford played for Yorkshire's second eleven in the  in 1951 before joining Gloucestershire for 1952. Unable to displace regular wicketkeeper Andy Wilson, who was a far better batsman, he played just two first-class games in 1952 and one in 1953, and made only eight appearances in 1954, when Wilson was 44. In 1955, however, Rochford took over as the regular wicketkeeper, playing in 30 matches and making 60 dismissals, and being awarded his county cap. His batting did not develop, however, and his highest score of the season was just 16 not out. There were a few signs of batting improvement in 1956 when, with 31 not out against Oxford University, Rochford made his highest score, and with Bryan Wells,  and Francis McHugh in Gloucestershire's side, Rochford often batted far higher in the order than his batting talent warranted. He again made 60 dismissals in the season. After a few matches in 1957, he lost his place and with both Bobby Etheridge and Barrie Meyer available, he left the Gloucestershire staff at the end of the season.

Brandon is married to the former Robyn Mitchell and has two sons, Nicholas and Timothy.  Brandon is also uncle to Incarnate Word standout, Paul Townsen.\n\nBrandon played football at Air Academy High School in , Colorado. He went on to compete at the collegiate level as both a defensive back and wide receiver at Colorado Mesa University (1974) and University of Northern Colorado (1975\u201377). He graduated from Northern Colorado in 1978 with a bachelor's degree in education.\n\nBrandon began his coaching career as head football coach at Ellicott (Colo.) High School.

Jones and Alexander, who also appeared in the same roles in the stage versions, both received Best Actor and Actress  nominations for their performances.\n\nSet between 1910 and 1915, the story follows Jack Jefferson (James Earl Jones; patterned after real-life boxer Jack Johnson) going on a hot streak of victories in the boxing ring as he defeats every white boxer around. Soon the press and other whites announce the search for a \"great white hope\", a boxer who will defeat Jefferson for the Heavyweight title. Meanwhile, Jefferson prepares for a few more matches, but he lets his guard down by courting the beautiful (and very white) Eleanor Bachman (Jane Alexander), and when everyone, including Jack's black \"wife\", discover this, the tensions grow to fever pitch. Jack's close black friends become scared over his pushing the envelope of success and the white authorities conspire to frame him with unlawful sexual relations with Eleanor and thereby take away his title.

They are currently competing in F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1, having been relegated from Rugby Pro D2 at the end of the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nThe club was founded in 1908 under the name Stade For\u00e9zien Universitaire. They went through a difficult time in the 1960s, and had to merge with the CASE omnisport structure in 1975 at the request of the municipality. It did not help turn back the tide, however, and poor results and fewer and fewer licensed players forced the club to withdraw its senior team from all competitions in 1991. The next year, the club was restarted in 4\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, the lowest French rugby division, and was able to climb the ladder, gaining promotion to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 3 in 2004, one year after merging with the neighbouring club SEMUR and adopting its current name. In 2007, Saint-Etienne were promoted to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2. A mere two years later, they finished 13th overall in the championship, with the top 12 clubs being promoted to F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1. However,  declined their promotion, sending Saint-\u00c9tienne to the top amateur division for the first time.\n\nFor their first season in F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1, Saint-\u00c9tienne signed the coach  from Arras, and the international fullback Alexandre P\u00e9clier from Lyon. They had an impressive start with two away wins in their first two games, and on November 7, they took on B\u00e9ziers in Andr\u00e9zieux-Bouth\u00e9on's . The 3,000 people in the stadium were not the only ones to witness the locals' 15\u20139 victory though, as the match was broadcast live on Eurosport, a first for a F\u00e9d\u00e9rale 1 game. This run of good form allowed them to clinch the fourth place in their group and thus to qualify for the Troph\u00e9e Jean Prat. In the second phase, they finished second behind Tyrosse and qualified for the Round of 16 where they faced Nice. They prevailed 19\u201318 thanks to a last-second drop-goal by P\u00e9clier and faced Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, one of the favorites for promotion, in the quarters. Saint-\u00c9tienne stunned them by winning both legs (12\u20133 at home, 24\u201320 away), inflicting them their only home defeat of the season in the process. In the semis, they took on Bourg-en-Bresse. The popular support for the team was such that the municipality allowed the first leg to be played in Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.

{"id": "D-block_contraction", "bracket": "0.3-0.4", "text": "d-block contraction (sometimes called scandide contraction) is a term used in chemistry to describe the effect of having  full d orbitals on the period 4 elements. The elements in question are the  Ga, Ge, As, Se and Br. Their electronic configurations include completely filled d orbitals (d10). d-block contraction is best illustrated by comparing some properties of the group 13 elements to highlight the effect on gallium.\n\nGallium can be seen to be anomalous. The most obvious effect is that the sum of the first three s of gallium is higher than that of aluminium, whereas the trend in the group would be for it to be lower. The second table below shows the trend in the sum of the first three ionization potentials for the elements B, Al, Sc, Y, La. Sc, Y, La are group 3 elements and have three valence electrons above a noble gas electron core.  In contrast to the group 13 elements this sequence shows a smooth reduction.\n\nOther effects of the d-block contraction are that the Ga3+ ion is smaller than expected, being closer in size to Al3+. Care must be taken in interpreting the ionization potentials for indium and thallium, other effects e.g. the inert pair effect become increasingly important for the heavier members of the group.\n\nThe cause of the d-block contraction is the poor  shielding of the nuclear charge by the  electrons in the d orbitals. The  outer valence electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus causing the observed increase in ionization potentials. The d-block contraction can  be compared to the lanthanide contraction\n", "index": [[145, 151], [198, 200], [202, 204], [206, 208], [210, 212], [217, 219], [373, 390], [739, 740], [742, 744], [746, 748], [750, 751], [753, 755], [757, 759], [761, 762], [764, 766], [771, 786], [829, 838], [874, 891], [1161, 1178], [1543, 1565]], "wikipedia_ids": [181554, 12241, 12242, 897, 27117, 3756, 144929, 3755, 904, 27116, 20373503, 17744, 27116, 20373503, 17744, 306609, 21140, 144929, 827232, 2168393], "wikipedia_titles": ["Period 4 element", "Gallium", "Germanium", "Arsenic", "Selenium", "Bromine", "Boron group", "Boron", "Aluminium", "Scandium", "Yttrium", "Lanthanum", "Scandium", "Yttrium", "Lanthanum", "Group 3 element", "Noble gas", "Boron group", "Inert-pair effect", "Lanthanide contraction"]}
{"id": "Nucleoid", "bracket": "1", "text": "The nucleoid (meaning nucleus-like) is an irregularly-shaped region within the cell of a prokaryote that contains all or most of the genetic material.  In contrast to the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, it is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The genome of prokaryotic organisms generally is a circular, double-stranded piece of DNA, of which multiple copies may exist at any time. The length of a genome widely varies, but generally is at least a few million base pairs.\n\nA genophore is the DNA of a prokaryote. It is commonly referred to as a prokaryotic chromosome. The term \"chromosome\" is misleading for a genophore because the genophore lacks chromatin. The genophore is compacted through a mechanism known as , whereas a chromosome is additionally compacted via chromatin.  The genophore is circular in most prokaryotes, and linear in very few. The circular nature of the genophore allows replication to occur without . Genophores are generally of a much smaller size than Eukaryotic chromosomes. A genophore can be as small as 580,073 base pairs (Mycoplasma genitalium). Many eukaryotes (such as plants and animals) carry genophores in organelles such as  and . These organelles are very similar to true prokaryotes.\n\nThe nucleoid can be clearly visualized on an  at high magnification, where, although its appearance may differ, it is clearly visible against the cytosol.

With the themes of her writing and her Swedish maiden name she profited from the German interest for Scandinavian writers.\n\nBorn the daughter of a physician and a peasant woman in Karlskrona and brought up in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 (Sweden), she was bed-ridden owing to illness up to her twelfth year. It was only after that, from about 1897, that she started to frequent various private schools in V\u00e4xj\u00f6. In 1903, she went to Hildesheim (Germany) and shortly afterwards to Braunschweig (Germany) in order to learn the German language. On April 17th 1905 she married, in V\u00e4xj\u00f6, the son of her teacher, 15 years her senior, and in 1906 gave birth to their son Gustav Adolf. She got divorced in 1909 after she had been left by her husband. Nordstr\u00f6m returned to V\u00e4xj\u00f6 for a short time and in the same year moved to Berlin to become a photographer. After three years of instruction and practical training, she had to give up her profession for health reasons. In 1912 she went to Munich to become a writer. It was there that in 1914 she met Siegfried von Vegesack, whom she married on February 16th in Stockholm.\n\nIn 1916 she moved with her husband to Berlin, where in April 1917 her daughter Isabel was born (who died in 2005). Because of an ailment of Siegfried von Vegesack\u2019s, the family in 1917 moved to a farm near Dingolfing and later to Gro\u00dfwalding near Deggendorf. In 1918 they acquired a corn tower near Regen, which they refurbished into a residential tower. In 1920 Karin their second daughter was born but died only a few days later. In 1923 their son Gotthard was born, to be killed in action in the Second World War in 1944. In the same year Nordstr\u00f6m published her first novel \"Tomtelilla\" both in Germany and in Sweden. With her mother\u2019s death an important source of income had run dry. Therefore, Nordstr\u00f6m opened up, in the tower, a place for artists and writers to live. In these years the couple started gradually to grow apart. In 1929 the family moved to Switzerland. Shortly afterwards Clara Nordstr\u00f6m moved with her children to Stuttgart and got a divorce in 1935 at Vegesack\u2019s wish. In that year she started to read from her works all over Germany.\n\nFrom her German base, she also wrote articles in the Swedish  press. In 1936 she returned for a short period to the residential tower in Wei\u00dfenstein near Regen and in 1938/39 she built a house in Baiersbronn in the Black Forest. In 1944 she was called to K\u00f6nigsberg to read from her texts for the radio station run by the German  transmitting in Swedish, but in 1944 had to flee to Hamburg.\n\nThroughout her life she again and again had to struggle with severe ailments and therefore intensely questioned her faith, which is what the characters in her books do.

It has its origins in the 15th century war with the English for control of France when a victorious Charles VII of France gave the domain and great forest of Oiron to Guillaume Gouffier who became governor of Touraine. This ch\u00e2teau is the background for Charles Perrault's fairy tale, Puss in Boots. King Louis XIV's mistress,  was one of the residents in the place.\n\nToday, Oiron is only a short drive from the royal ch\u00e2teaux in the Val de Loire, but in the 15th century it was considered far removed from the seat of power at the royal domains. Nonetheless, Guillaume Gouffier built a magnificent ch\u00e2teau and his offspring updated and improved it. In 1538, his daughter-in-law, , was responsible for the construction of a collegiate church adjacent to the ch\u00e2teau. In 1551, Henry II and his entire court were guests of Claude Gouffier who had been granted the title Marquis de Caravaz. Claude Gouffier served as the model for Charles Perrault's \"Marquis de Carabas\" in his story, Puss in Boots.\n\nTwo generations later, another Gouffier was exiled from the king's court by Cardinal Richelieu in 1620. In the mid 17th century, Charlotte Gouffier became enamored with the renowned intellect, Blaise Pascal (1623\u201362), who spent considerable time at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Oiron. After Pascal died, Charlotte Gouffier married Francois d'Aubusson, the duc de La Feuillade, who enhanced the castle with his wealth and connections to Louis XIV. With the renovations, the castle ended up with a main building and two long projecting wings, one of which is a Renaissance structure built over a cloister. One of the galleries contains one of the most prestigious works of art from the French Renaissance period.\n\nThe Duc de La Feuillade's son sold the ch\u00e2teau to Louis XIV's mistress,  who lived there for the rest of her life. Her son had little interest in the property as he preferred to be much closer to the royal court so in 1736 he sold the ch\u00e2teau to the . After that, the ch\u00e2teau went into severe decline and in 1793 was ransacked by Revolutionaries. For many years the ch\u00e2teau lay abandoned until the government of France took possession just before World War II eventually converting it to a museum.\n\nRecognized world wide, the museum is dedicated to contemporary art.

They were active in the movement called the Country Party.  They promoted republicanism and had a great influence on Republicanism in the United States, but little impact in Britain.\n\nThe most noted commonwealthmen were John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, who wrote the seminal work Cato's Letters between 1720 and 1723. Other members include Robert Crowley, , Thomas Beccon, Thomas Lever, and John Hales.  They condemned corruption and lack of morality in British political life, theorizing that only civic virtue could protect a country from despotism and ruin.\n\nTheir criticism about enclosure and the general material plight of the poor was particularly notable to early twentieth-century scholars like  who saw in them a valuable though regrettably abortive form of  that represented a preferable alternative to the view of Max Weber that Protestantism enabled and sustained the rise of capitalism. On the other hand, it has been argued that the Commonwealthmen \"by no means stand against an individualistic or capitalistic spirit, and--despite what [for example, historians JGA Pocock and Gordon Wood] have claimed--are far from espousing classical virtue or the Aristotelian conception of man as zoon politikon [a political animal].\" '\n\nAlthough nearly all British politicians and thinkers rejected the ideas of the commonwealth men, these writers had a powerful effect on British colonial America. It is estimated that half the private libraries in the  held bound volumes of Cato's Letters on their shelves.

He is said to have worked wonders during the reign of king (pharaoh) Nebka ().\n\nUbaoner appears only in the second story of the Westcar Papyrus \u2013 there is no  or historical evidence that he existed. Nevertheless he is an object of great interest for , since his magical trick is connected to later cultural perceptions of the personality of king Nebka. In the story, Ubaoner is described as a high lector priest.\n\nAccording to the Westcar Papyrus, Ubaoner is betrayed by his own wife several times. She secretly loves a commoner who resides at Memphis and sends him expensive clothes and other material. The commoner comes to visit Ubaoner's wife and says to her: \u201cIsn't there a pavilion at the lake?\u201d The wife says: \u201cSee, let's spend some time in there.\u201d She calls for Ubaoner's caretaker and orders him: \u201cPrepare the pavilion with all good things.\u201d And so Ubaoner's wife and the commoner spend their time in the pavilion drinking together, until they were finished. Later that evening the commoner is picked up by his maidservant, who was waiting at the lake. Ubaoner's caretaker was waiting there, too and he says: \u201cI will go to Ubaoner.\u201d Two days later the caretaker tells everything to Ubaoner and makes the comment: \u201cSee, it was your wife who spent a day in your pavilion; she was together with that commoner you know. It was adultery what he did, two times, at your lake.\u201d Thereupon, Ubaoner says to the caretaker: \u201cBring me a pair of [...] made of ebony and dja'am. I will create [...] and send it as a harbinger.\u201d He creates a small figurine of wax in the shape of a crocodile with a length of seven fingers. He bewitches the figurine and gives it to his caretaker with the words: \u201cWhen he comes to purify himself in the lake, this commoner, then you may throw this crocodile made of wax after him.\u201d The caretaker does as ordered and waits until the next day. The next morning Ubaoner's wife orders the caretaker: \u201cLet the pavilion at the lake be prepared, for I will sit in it.\u201d Thereupon she spends the whole day in the pavilion together with the commoner. Later that evening the commoner leaves the pavilion to take a bath in the lake. The caretaker quickly throws the wax figurine after the stranger and when the idol touches the water it becomes a real, living crocodile 3.70m in length. The animal devours the commoner and disappears in the depths of the lake for seven days. During these seven days Ubaoner is received by pharaoh Nebka for an important audience. After the audience Ubaoner invites Nebka to visit his house with the words: \u201cMay thy majesty proceed and see the wonder that has happened in the time of thy majesty [...] a commoner.\u201d. Nebka and Ubaoner walk to the lake where Ubaoner orders the crocodile to come out of the water and to release the commoner. When king Nebka sees that he says: \u201cThis crocodile is dangerous!\u201d But Ubaoner bends down and touches the crocodile and immediately it becomes a figurine of wax again. Then Ubaoner gives a report to Nebka about the affairs. Nebka tells the crocodile: \u201cTake away what is yours!\u201d and the animal grabs the commoner and then disappears. The wife of Ubaoner is brought to Nebka, too and the pharaoh sentence her to death. She is brought to a place east of the palace and burnt alive.

They hold that the story of Ubaoner describes a classical case of adultery through the wife and a typical sort of punishment for that during the Old Kingdom (in this case it is the ).

The term track refers to the tracking of a vehicles simulated movements in relation to geometry, based upon vehicle dimensions, chassis and steering specification.\n\nAutoTrack is generally used by transportation engineers, architects and planners for the analysis and design of , ,  and other facilities to check that provision has been made for the space and geometry required to manouvre specified design . A design vehicle may be a real vehicle modelled within the software's computer environment but will often be a virtual vehicle that does not exist in real life, but rather is indicative of the type and configuration of vehicle that the final design is expected to accommodate. Design vehicles are commonly specified by the relevant governing body that also controls the specification for which the design must conform.\n\nThe AutoTrack range is divided into modules that service the Road,  and  industries and operates within several different  systems such as AutoCAD by Autodesk,  by Bentley Systems, Bricscad by Bricsys (a former member of the ) and standalone in Microsoft Windows.

Two years later he became a , a player who travels the country looking for gambling action.\n\nIn 1949, Moss played with  in a five month long \"heads up\" poker marathon set up by Benny Binion, winning between $2 and $4 million.  At the conclusion of the game, Nick the Greek uttered what has become one of the most famous poker quotes ever: \"Mr. Moss, I have to let you go.\"  This game is often cited as the inspiration behind the WSOP.  This game became the foundation for Al Alvarez's book The Biggest Game in Town and is one of the best known stories in poker.  Despite being one of the best known poker stories, a soon to be released book, Showgirl Stories, by Steve Fischer claims the game never took place.  According to Fischer, there were no stories or reports of this tournament until six years after Nick's death.  Binion never spoke of the game even when providing a detailed history of Las Vegas and avoided answering questions about the game by saying, \"Well, my memory ain't what it used to be.\"  While Nick the Greek was often covered by the national media, there are no news reports in any Vegas or national source. Fischer says that nearly every version of the story is virtually identical to the version first told by Moss beginning around 1971. The story is consistently said to have taken place in 1949 at the Horseshoe Casino, a casino that did not exist for another year and a half.  Fischer also points out that during the time that Binion supposedly set up the game, he was fighting off a request from Texas to have him extradited.  Because of his past, Binion lost his license to run a gambling establishment in 1948 and did not regain it until April 13, 1950.  He was not granted a license to open the Horseshoe Casino until December 5, 1952.  Fischer believes that the notion of Binion sponsoring a poker game, in front of a window, of a casino that hasn't opened, while fighting extradition is \"absurd.\"\n\nMoss won the 1970, 1971, and 1974 World Series of Poker main events. For the 1970 WSOP, Moss was actually elected champion by his peers and received a silver cup as his prize. A (possibly apocryphal) story about that election which has appeared in print several times has every one of the eight players voting for himself as the best player, and that it was only when the players were asked to vote for the second best player that Moss emerged. He played at every WSOP from 1970 through the 1995 World Series, and during his career he won nine WSOP bracelets, placing him fourth overall, behind Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson (10 each) and Phil Hellmuth\n", "index": [[59, 66], [84, 89], [129, 150], [184, 193], [298, 308], [402, 420], [440, 455], [481, 486], [661, 667], [1009, 1021], [2776, 2780], [2782, 2786], [2792, 2796], [2797, 2818], [3250, 3271], [3358, 3369], [3374, 3387], [3402, 3415]], "wikipedia_ids": [11921, 23014, 33116, 9333505, 141837, 947231, 136027, 29810, 272207, 979605, 2195921, 3883586, 3750706, 33116, 3696471, 923414, 255519, 207599], "wikipedia_titles": ["Gambling", "Poker", "World Series of Poker", "Cash game", "Poker tournament", "Poker Hall of Fame", "Marshall, Texas", "Texas", "Bar (establishment)", "Benny Binion", "1970 World Series of Poker", "1971 World Series of Poker", "1974 World Series of Poker", "World Series of Poker", "1995 World Series of Poker", "Johnny Chan", "Doyle Brunson", "Phil Hellmuth"]}

It was founded under the name of Progressive Socialist Rally in 1983, gained legal recognition in 1988 and was renamed Progressive Democratic Party in 2001. Under the rule of Ben Ali it was a legal opposition party, but subjected to political repression. After the Tunisian revolution it was one of the major left-leaning secular political forces. It was led by Ahmed Najib Chebbi and Maya Jribi. On 9 April 2012, it merged into the Republican Party.\n\nIn its beginnings, the Progressive Socialist Rally (now PDP) gathered a broad range of currents from Marxists and pro-democracy activists to progressive Muslims. During the Ben Ali rule, Najib Chebbi and the PDP were harassed by the police for years, and verbally attacked by state-run media. After unsuccessfully participating in elections from 1989 to 1999, the party decided to boycot the elections of 2004 and 2009. Therefore it was unrepresented in the Tunisian parliament. After the Ben Ali administration announced to force the party to move their head quarters from Tunis, its leaders Najib Chebbi and Maya Jribi engaged in a 20-days hunger strike, which earned the party attention and prompted the administration to revoke their decision.\n\nFollowing the , shootings outside PDP's headquarter were reported on 16 January 2011. The next day, on 17 January, party leader Najib Chebbi, was named  in the interim government. Ahead of the Constituent Assembly election, the PDP evolved into a main exponent of the centre-left secular camp and rival of the Islamist Ennahda Movement. In the run-up to the elections, the Progressive Democrats have received quite an amount of financial support which enabled the party for a lavish campaign. Critics claim that an important part of the funding came from businesspeople close to the old Ben Ali power elite.\n\nIn the election for a constituent assembly, the PDP won 3.9% of the popular vote and 16 of 217 seats in the National Constituent Assembly, putting it at the fifth place. As the party had categorically ruled out any collaboration with the victorious Islamist Ennahda Movement, the Progressive Democrats went into opposition and belong to the outspoken critics of the governing coalition of the Islamists with the secular CPR and  parties. After the electoral defeat, the PDP launched talks with other secularist and liberal parties to form a \"big party of the centre\".
