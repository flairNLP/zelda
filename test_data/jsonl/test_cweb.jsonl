has almost come to define its field\n- but it's certainly not the right photo editor for every user. To begin\nwith it's expensive and its high-end power is overkill for the average\nhome user. More importantly, for this largest market of all, Photoshop\nfails to provide any functionality in the most important area of all -\ndedicated handling of digital camera images. While Paint Shop Pro (see\npage ) tries to match Photoshop's functionality across the board at a\nbudget price, MGI PhotoSuite has instead chosen to try and fill the gap\nby targeting the more focused needs of the home photographer.\nIt's not just PhotoSuite's intended use that is so different. While Paint Shop Pro slavishly tries to copy the traditional Photoshop-style interface,\nPhotoSuite breaks new ground. Running down the left-hand side of the screen\nis the Activity panel which provides guided assistance to all commands\nand tools, while across the top of the screen is the navigation bar with\nbuttons for accessing the program's seven main modules - Get, Prepare,\nCompose, Organize, Share, Print and Browse. In many ways using the program\nis like visiting a well-structured and well thought-through Web site.\nThis shouldn't be too surprising as PhotoSuite is actually built on an\nembedded version of Internet Explorer 5.\nThe first of the PhotoSuite modules is Get which is used to access your\nimages from your computer or scanner or digital camera. The number of\ncameras PhotoSuite 4 supports directly - Agfa, Epson, Kodak and Olympus\n- has been increased, but you should be able to access most models through\nthe generic TWAIN interface. One limitation, especially compared to Paint Shop Pro's excellent image browser, is that the standard Open dialog can\nonly show one image preview at a time. MGI has thrown in a simple standalone\nViewer utility to help you quickly identify files but again this is restricted\nto showing single images.\nThis is disappointing, but PhotoSuite makes up for it with its Organize\nmodule. This lets you store multiple image thumbnails in named albums-\nideal for handling all your holiday or product shots for example. It takes\na little work to set up compared to Paint Shop Pro's instant browsing,\nbut it offers more power. To begin with you can add keywords for searching\nand sorting. More importantly, albums can be used as the basis for slideshows,\nprinting and Web display.\nPhotoSuite specializes in dealing with sets of images\n- ideal for PC Photography.\nAlbums also come into their own in the Prepare module as their images\ncan be displayed in the Library panel down the right hand side of the\nscreen and dragged and dropped onto the central image window for editing.\nThe Prepare module is itself split into separate modules, such as Rotate\nand Crop, TouchUp and Paint and Draw, to cover all editing tasks. The\nlevel of power on offer isn't quite up to Paint Shop Pro levels, but more\nusers will feel comfortable with PhotoSuite's simple Brightness/Contrast,\nGamma, Fix Colour and Image Enhance commands than with Paint Shop Pro's\nhistogram adjustments and technical filters.\nIn terms of new power the Prepare module sees four main enhancements.\nThe first is the introduction of the Photo Sprayer tool. This is a pretty\ntypical image hose used for spraying bitmap objects, such as flowers and\nbutterflies, onto your image. Again the control on offer is surprisingly\nadvanced with customisable size, spread and opacity and you can also create\nyour own nozzles. The second is a reworking of the existing PhotoTapestry\neffect. This takes an image and recreates it as a series of tiles based\non the collection of 30,000 supplied thumbnails. Now you can add your\nown image to the tile set or create a new set from scratch - though this\nis only practical if you have plenty of images and plenty of disk space!\nMuch the most impressive new feature is the complete overhaul of PhotoSuite's\nStitching capabilities based on PhotoVista technology MGI acquired from\nLivePicture. Now you can create seamless panoramas simply by dragging\nup to 48 images onto the main image window, roughly positioning them and\nthen selecting your camera lens type. You can even choose to create 360-degree\nimmersive panoramas. Generally the process is simple and the results are\nimpressive and you could easily expect to pay more for less powerful dedicated\nstitching software.\nThe Stitching feature is excellent for building up\npanoramas.\nThe fourth new editing advance is the improvement in what PhotoSuite\ncalls its \"cut-out\" handling. Essentially a cut-out is any selection of\nthe image that you make using the various marquee, magic wand and edge\nfinder tools and then float above the underlying image. Now cut-outs can\nbe stored by quickly sending them to the Library or by saving them to\nfile. You can also now change the edge fading and the overall opacity\nof the cut-out to make it seem a more integral part of the underlying\nimage.\nThis is undoubtedly a step forward but PhotoSuite definitely\nisn't the right program for producing advanced layer-based compositions.\nInstead its cut-outs are better seen as object-based props and indeed\nPhotoSuite provides a selection of props, such as hats and hair, for producing\nphoto-based projects in its Compose module. The obvious use is for producing\nhumorous cards and generally having a bit of fun but, amongst its selection\nof over 1200 templates, PhotoSuite also includes some high-resolution\nbusiness options for producing calendars, posters, business cards and\nso on.\nThe Compose module offers thousands of photo-based\nprojects.\nOnce you've finished preparing your photo or your project, the next step\nis to let others see it. The traditional approach to this is catered for\nwith PhotoSuite's Print module. This offers a print preview in which you\ncan size and position your image either automatically or interactively.\nAlternatively using the enhanced Print Multiple command you can print\nmultiple copies of the same image on the same page - important when photo-quality\npaper is so expensive. As well as generic layouts PhotoSuite now provides\nlayouts designed for Kodak and Avery stock, but there's still no option\nto create your own layout or to print different images on the same page.\nAlternatively you can cut out the need for paper completely\nwith the Share module. This lets you turn albums into slideshows complete\nwith full control over timings and transitions. You can also add sound\nand PhotoSuite 4 now supports MP3. If the person you want to show your\nphotos to isn't actually present you can use PhotoSuite's e-mail capability.\nThis lets you send individual or multiple files and lets you automatically\nconvert images to JPEG with the option of specifying a desired size. You\ncan even choose to send slideshows complete with an embedded player. Alternatively\nfor the widest possible access you can post your images to GatherRound.com.\nThe Share module lets you create advanced slideshows\nwhich can be sent as email.\nWeb access of this sort is increasingly important and PhotoSuite's Share\nmodule offers two new dedicated Web commands. The first is the Animated GIF command that lets you create and edit simple bitmap-based animations\nfor inclusion on your Web page. Like the slideshow feature this is based\non a storyline under the main image window where you can drag frames and\nset up transitions. This is effective for slideshow-style effects but\nuseless for others such as motion-based animation. Here you have to edit\nindividual frames and trying to swap between Share and Prepare modules\nsoon becomes a major headache.\nThe second new command lets you output image albums or selected images\nas Web pages. This support is based on the use of pre-designed templates\nthat you can customise to add your own titles, captions and dates. You\ncan also add or delete any object on the page, which is just as well as\nthe default designs are pretty awful with horrendous backgrounds and distracting\nanimated GIFs. Once you've customised a template, however, the end results\nare generally impressive though I would have preferred some simpler templates\nbased on a thumbnail index and full-size image pages rather than the combined\nslideshow pages.\nWeb templates can be customised - which is just as\nwell.\nAll told PhotoSuite's Web capabilities are a mixed bag with advanced\nfeatures in some areas and surprising weaknesses in others. In particular\nthe omission of any serious JPEG and GIF optimisation control is bizarre\n- why would you want to produce animated GIFs but not ordinary optimised\nGIFs? Hopefully PhotoSuite 5 will include a dedicated Save for Web dialog\nwith in-built preview and advanced JPEG and GIF control. In the meantime\nbudget users for whom Web imaging is important might well want to hold\noff to see what the imminent release of the Web-oriented PhotoImpact 6\noffers.\nPhotoSuite's mixed Web-imaging capabilities are particularly strange\nas otherwise the program has completely embraced the Net. In particular\nPhotoSuite's final module, Browse, takes advantage of its underlying browser-based\narchitecture to let you surf the Net from within the application! This\nlets you drag and drop images directly from the Web onto your library\n- copyright permitting. Via the dedicated PhotoSuite web site you can\nalso access extra content, new project templates, additional filters,\nonline tutorials and so on - all of which become a seamless part of the\nexisting program.\nThis is impressive stuff and MGI is leading the way when it comes to\nmerging computer and Web, application and content. There is a downside\nto PhotoSuite's browser-based approach, however, in that the program can\nsometimes seem unresponsive and really requires a speedy system to feel\ncomfortable. Other possible reasons for looking elsewhere include the\nlack of advanced features such as vector, channel and layer-based editing.\nIt's certainly true that you get more all-round power with a traditional\napplication like Paint Shop Pro\n", "index": [[4634, 4643], [4908, 4917], [5040, 5054], [5082, 5091], [5332, 5346], [5387, 5396], [6145, 6149], [6151, 6156], [6158, 6163], [6168, 6175], [6263, 6268], [6319, 6333], [6834, 6848], [7225, 7232], [7530, 7544], [7626, 7634], [7636, 7641], [7691, 7705], [9413, 9420], [10771, 10776], [10781, 10786], [11130, 11133], [11341, 11345], [11772, 11784], [12188, 12193], [13098, 13101], [13261, 13265], [13325, 13328], [13469, 13472], [13482, 13493], [13626, 13629], [13672, 13678], [13761, 13764], [14619, 14633]], "wikipedia_ids": [24893, 24893, 24894, 24893, 24894, 24893, 167752, 1082784, 57627, 57143, 151998, 24894, 24894, 17727, 24894, 5611461, 68466, 24894, 17727, 57627, 1681976, 19673, 16009, 12702, 867877, 12702, 313345, 12702, 33139, 2985750, 15645247, 576303, 15645247, 24894], "wikipedia_titles": ["Adobe Photoshop", "Adobe Photoshop", "PaintShop Pro", "Adobe Photoshop", "PaintShop Pro", "Adobe Photoshop", "Agfa-Gevaert", "Epson", "Kodak", "Olympus Corporation", "TWAIN", "PaintShop Pro", "PaintShop Pro", "Library", "PaintShop Pro", "Contrast (vision)", "Gamma correction", "PaintShop Pro", "Library", "Kodak", "Avery Dennison", "MP3", "JPEG", "GIF", "Share (finance)", "GIF", "Save (baseball)", "GIF", "World Wide Web", "Ulead PhotoImpact", "Net (economics)", "Browsing", "Net (economics)", "PaintShop Pro"]}

Burning coal from the Permian-Triassic boundary may be to blame.\nCredit:\u00a0David Large/University of Nottingham\nUnvented household stoves in Xuan Wei have increased exposure to smoke and particulate matter during cooking and heating. Women, who spend more time in the home, have a higher lung cancer risk than men.\nCredit:\u00a0David Large/University of Nottingham\nThe multiple flood basalt flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group, which erupted about 15 million years ago and covered more than 170,000 square kilometers, were only a fraction of the size of the Siberian flood basalts that erupted about 250 million years ago.\nCredit:\u00a0Wikimedia Commons\nAt the close of the Permian, 252 million years ago, conditions on Earth took a turn for the worse, nearly wiping out life on land and at sea in the planet\u2019s most severe extinction event. Now, eons later, geologists are implicating a coal seam that dates to the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d at the Permian-Triassic boundary in one of the modern world\u2019s worst cancer epidemics.\nSince the 1980s, epidemiologists have been scouring Xuan Wei County in southwestern China for the smoking gun responsible for the region\u2019s astronomically high incidence of lung cancer. Home to 1.2 million Chinese, Xuan Wei has the some of the highest lung cancer mortality rates in the world, 20 times higher than the rest of China. A new study published in Environmental Science & Technology suggests that an unusually high concentration of fine-grained silicon dioxide, or silica, particles in the region\u2019s coal could be to blame.\nTwo years ago, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a division of the World Health Organization, declared silica a carcinogen. Fine particles, which can be easily inhaled into the lungs, are a particularly virulent threat. David Large, a geologist at the University of Nottingham in England and lead author of the new study, and his colleagues examined Xuan Wei\u2019s bituminous coal, which is primarily burned in household stoves for heat. They found that it contains a high concentration of fine-grained silica particles.\n\u201cThis was the first time that geologists looked at Xuan Wei\u2019s coal in detail and we found it is quite unique and potentially more toxic than most,\u201d Large says. \u201cEpidemiologists have long suspected the cancer was linked to the coal, but they didn\u2019t know why this particular coal from this region was so toxic.\u201d\n\u201cThis study goes a long way to answering our big question of \u2018Why here?\u2019\u201d says Robert Chapman, an epidemiologist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand who has studied the Xuan Wei cancer cluster for more than 25 years but was not involved in the new research. The study is not conclusive, he says, and more work is needed to establish the medical link between the coal's high silica content and this type of lung cancer. But, he says, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if silica turned out to be one of the bad actors in Xuan Wei.\u201d\nThat Xuan Wei\u2019s uniquely toxic coal deposit occurs directly below the Permian-Triassic boundary is no coincidence, Large says. \u201cHere we have this very toxic coal and right on top of it is one of the most extreme climatic and environmental events that has ever happened on Earth,\u201d he says. The massive Siberian Traps volcanic flows that spewed carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere 250 million years ago would have created a very acidic atmosphere, which would have lead to enhanced weathering of the solidified lava, Large says, including the Emeishan basalt deposits local to Xuan Wei. Such weathering would produce silica-rich groundwater that could have settled in highly permeable peat bogs, impregnating the future coal seam with silica particles early in its diagenesis.\nThe Xuan Wei situation is something of a geologic perfect storm, Large says. \u201cAs far as we know, this is the only place in the world where people are burning coal from the Permian-Triassic boundary,\u201d he says. Furthermore, because the silica content is so high, the coal\u2019s carbon and volatile content is relatively low, so people have to burn more of it to produce adequate heat.\nNow that Large and colleagues have identified what makes Xuan Wei\u2019s coal unique, Chapman says, more research is needed from a medical perspective to determine whether the silica is solely to blame or whether other compounds, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, may be playing a role as well.\nCurrently, investigators from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), based in Bethesda, Md., are conducting a systematic study, trying to link exposure rates to lung cancer cases in Xuan Wei. \u201cWe are looking at all the possibilities, including exposure to silica, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and radon,\u201d says Nathaniel Rothman, a physician specializing in environmental medicine at the cancer institute and an investigator on the NCI study.\nThe NCI study is an important step because while coal has been linked to cancers and other serious illness for years, \u201cwe know surprisingly little about the number of components of coal-fire gas that are toxic and how much exposure will lead to illness,\u201d says Glenn Stracher, an expert on coal fires at East Georgia College in Swainsboro, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cEvery coal fire is different and some produce more toxic or carcinogenic gas components than others.\u201d\nThe NCI study will take several years to complete, Rothman says.

Since then Mr. Fix-It\u2014as he became known\u2014has overturned Nissan like, well, like a tsunami. But a tsunami of goodness! Now mainstream Nissans are praised for delivering value-for-dollar and fine driving dynamics, and the company also makes lustworthy cars for motorheads (the 370Z, the GT-R, the G-series Infinitis) and even ecophiliacs. Nissan\u2019s zero-emission Leaf is the world\u2019s first mass-produced electric vehicle.\nThere\u2019s a dark lining to every silver cloud, though, and for Nissan it\u2019s the urge to build cars for Generation X. Or maybe it\u2019s Y or even Z by now; they who wear their ball caps sideways and call me \u201cdude.\u201d Thus Nissan also makes the two ugliest vehicles this side of the former Soviet Bloc: the cube (no capital letter) and this, the JUKE (all capitals). Every time I see it I think of a rhinoceros calf. Then I climb in and drive away and am reminded that rhinos are remarkably agile animals. And their babies are actually sort of cute.\nNo question that the Juke is right-sized for today\u2019s new reality, at least for drivers who don\u2019t cart Little League teams around. (It\u2019s the same length as a Mini Countryman.) The rear seats are tolerable for two adults, so long as they\u2019re not six-footers, and you can stack a week\u2019s groceries inside the tailgate without having to fold them down. The back seats, that is. By the way, this does have rear doors; the latches are up there by the windows. Fuel economy that is only in the mid-20s is disappointing, but consider two things: This Juke has all-wheel drive, which adds weight; and all Jukes have a 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine tuned for 188 horsepower. Those ponies make the Juke pretty lively. Dipping into the throttle squirts the car through traffic, while sensors and a computer keep a close eye on wheel spin. We\u2019ve gotten accustomed to AWD systems that split power between the front and rear wheels as needed, but this Nissan can also divide it side-to-side, at least at the back wheels. (The 2WD Juke is pulled around by its front wheels, and it lacks independent suspension at the rear wheels.) In hard cornering or acceleration I can feel the car settle down under the grip of the AWD. Then the Juke corners nimbly and with a lot less understeer than expected. The steering is quick enough to contribute to this deftness.\nA 6-speed manual gearbox is available. The automatic transmission is a continuously variable type with Sport and Eco modes. Nissan says these settings also tweak the steering and throttle behavior; I can\u2019t tell the difference, but the CVT does perform well.\nFor 2012 Nissan offers eight models of Juke: S CVT FWD, S CVT AWD, SV CVT FWD, SV M/T FWD, SV CVT AWD, SL CVT FWD, SL M/T FWD and SL CVT AWD. I think this means there\u2019s one for every budget, priced from the high teens to the middle twenties, and all manner of upper-end options are on the menu. Our sample has leather seats, satnav and satradio, a USB port, push-button starting, stereo and cruise-control switches in the steering wheel and so on. I can do without the oddly contoured garnet-red console, but now I\u2019m just being an old fuddy-duddy.\nIt\u2019s not a joke, it\u2019s a Juke. And, as the saying has it, when you\u2019re behind the wheel, the ugly goes away.\n\u00ab Back to blog\nComments\nThank you for the abuse report.\nWe will review the report and take appropriate action.\nLoading comments...\nSearch This Blog\nFollow This Blog\nRSS\nAbout this blog\n>\nSilvio Calabi reviews the latest from Detroit, Munich, Yokohama, Gothenburg, Crewe, Seoul and wherever else interesting cars are born.

It\u2019s disappointing and unfortunate that we have to deal with this in the middle of the season. \u201cIt is what it is, so right now as a team we have to focus on the things we can control, and we have a very challenging game here against a very talented opponent in Florida. We have to get ready to play the game.\u201dGrant suspended Green, Releford and Steele indefinitely just before Saturday\u2019s loss at LSU for violating team rules, sending them packing for Tuscaloosa before tipoff.That was also the second game of Mitchell\u2019s suspension.The disciplinary actions left the Tide (16-8, 5-5 Southeastern Conference) without players responsible for 69 percent of its scoring, 57 percent of rebounding and 54 percent of assists at a time when the stakes are ratcheted up. Green and Mitchell are the team\u2019s top scorers and rebounders, while Releford leads Alabama in assists and Steele is a key role player.Grant said his decision to hold the players out had much to do with the long-term quality of the program and trying to build \u201cthe values and standards that you want your team to represent.\u201d He hasn\u2019t elaborated on the reasons for the suspensions.Grant declined to say if the violations of Mitchell and Green were more serious, but reiterated that their suspension remained indefinite.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that, that\u2019s just the way it is right now,\u201d he said.This is the third time Grant has suspended Green, a first-team All-SEC player, during his three seasons, including a three-game string early last season and one game at the end of 2009-10.Grant didn\u2019t rule it out when asked if he had a \u201cthree-strike\u201d policy that might keep Green from returning.\u201cI\u2019ll make some decisions on that later,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now my focus is on getting prepared for Florida.\u201dAlabama had risen to No. 12 in the rankings in December and won three straight before the LSU game.The bold decision on the suspensions was no surprise to Gators coach Billy Donovan, who was Grant\u2019s boss for a dozen years at Marshall and Florida.\u201cI know Anthony Grant about as well as anybody, and I think that he has got incredible integrity and character and knows exactly the way he wants his program run and what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Donovan said.The Tide\u2019s eight remaining players \u2014 half of them freshmen \u2014 managed to come fairly close before losing 67-58 to LSU, with freshman Rodney Cooper scoring 28 points. Alabama had beaten Auburn by 18 points without Mitchell.Now comes a much bigger challenge, even with Releford and Steele.The Gators (19-6, 7-3) opened last March with a 78-51 rout of a Tide team that still had aspirations of winning an SEC title and making the NCAA field.Florida is also short-handed, but because of injuries. The Gators won\u2019t have their top subs, forward Will Yeguete (concussion) and guard Mike Rosario (bruised hip), for the game, Donovan\n", "index": [[2427, 2435], [2797, 2807], [2913, 2920], [2942, 2956], [2961, 2974], [3015, 3028], [3053, 3068], [3163, 3178], [3488, 3493], [3790, 3797], [3838, 3843], [3854, 3859], [3861, 3869], [3925, 3928], [3980, 3990], [4038, 4046], [4110, 4133], [4289, 4294], [4299, 4307], [4357, 4365], [4423, 4428], [4669, 4674], [4712, 4720], [4725, 4730], [4908, 4913], [4928, 4933], [4952, 4955], [5073, 5078], [5159, 5164], [5278, 5285], [5377, 5380], [5455, 5468], [5478, 5483], [5512, 5520], [5525, 5532], [5541, 5554], [5723, 5730], [5849, 5852], [5920, 5926], [5948, 5956], [6002, 6010], [6137, 6140], [6162, 6166], [6173, 6180], [6352, 6359]], "wikipedia_ids": [30812226, 57690, 18933066, 29516337, 30957146, 17125894, 30812226, 507399, 17125894, 18933066, 17125894, 29516337, 30812226, 5978520, 105167, 30957146, 79371, 29516337, 30957146, 30812226, 17125894, 17125894, 30957146, 29516337, 17125894, 29516337, 79371, 17125894, 29516337, 18933066, 5978520, 1443634, 17125894, 560365, 18933066, 17125894, 1443634, 5978520, 2846320, 30957146, 30812226, 79371, 507399, 18933066, 1443634], "wikipedia_titles": ["Trevor Releford", "Montgomery, Alabama", "Florida", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Anthony Grant", "Trevor Releford", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Anthony Grant", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Trevor Releford", "LSU Tigers football", "Tuscaloosa, Alabama", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Southeastern Conference", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Anthony Grant", "Anthony Grant", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "JaMychal Green", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Southeastern Conference", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Florida", "LSU Tigers football", "Billy Donovan", "Anthony Grant", "Marshall University", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "Billy Donovan", "LSU Tigers football", "Auburn Tigers football", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Southeastern Conference", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Florida", "Billy Donovan"]}

Nothing\nspecial sets them apart but maybe they are a little bit better in\nmarketing than their peers. For example Philips invented so many\nwonderful all the goodies, all best chips,\nmechanisms, etc and they don't have even 10 % of TEAC reputation.\nMaybe it is the VRDS thing - every hifi rag devoted countless pages\nexplaining the principle of very rigid disc clamping system - how the\npressure clamping disc \"prevents the CD from vibrations\" but in other\nplayers nothing prevents the vibrations and yet they still manage to\nplay well. So to me it seems like TEAC created an antidote to a\nnon existent poison, and then they sold the whole concept as their key\ndifferenciator and they had to invent the poison. Clever people.\nAnyway, they took the stock, middle of the range SONY mechanism KSS151A\n(like in Sony CDP227ESD player)\nand added a large puck on top of it. Is it good or bad - I dunno, but\nit looks positively hitech.\nTo be able to sell the story even better - in this VRDS 25 player (they\nnamed the player after the mechanism name - see how important the\nplastic puck is to their marketing?\u00a0 Sortof like calling a car\nTurbo.) they made the face plate of 10 mm solid aluminium and\neverything\nis oh-so-heavy.\nTo my big surprise - the main PCB is REALLY a very nice one. Almost\nlike in Copland. Premium parts, audio grade electrolytes, very very\nneat auto-CAD of PCB layout, fully differential balanced topology and\nOH MY GOD - the AD1862 super\nduper chip. What a rare DAC. A white raven. To be found only in world's\nbest players, like for example in the best denon - the 2560.\nThis DAC has current output (the better, more kosher type) and it can\nbe lampized with R conversion. I used 570 Ohms which I had on hand.\nI quickly cut the leg 11 of the chip from the PCB track (I mean I cut\nthe track leading from leg 11 to next parts - 4 opamps in a row per\nphase.)\nI wired the now freely floating leg 11 to lampizator leg 7 and then\nfrom leg 7 to leg 9 - a resistor of 570 Ohms.\nSurprisingly this player has balanced outputs.\nLampization is possible as SE ( RCA)\u00a0 and balanced\u00a0 XLR at\nthe same time.\nI quite like plain and simple face plates like this one. The only minor\nreservation in this player rating is it's very slow drawer.\nGolden drawer in black player. Hmmmm.....\nGreat PCB - neat, simple, beautiful - everything is first class. Hats\noff.\nASD-Audiotuning company from Germany offers upgrade replacement chips\nfor these two suckers on the picture's right - the demodulator and the\nupsampler- NPC and the AD1893. The better parts from Mr. Andreas (we\npaid some 100 Euro plus) are 24/192\u00a0 compatible and the DAC is a\n20 bit one. The clock is not typical - 18 ,xx meg. The upgrade allows\nto squeeze the max from the 1862 DAC. It took me 10 minutes do de\nsolder and solder the upgrade.\nI suspect that 1862 is the same as Burr Brown 1702. Something is\ntelling me ....\nEnter Analog\nDevices AD1862 N-J DAC chip\nFour DAC chips in\na row. Mmmmmmm. Nice. One per channel per phase. They\ngo like this from bottom of the photo :\u00a0 L-, L+, R+, L-. I took\nthe signal from the inner pair.\nPlease ignore the most right yellow wire - my mistake (left channel\nphase neg). Top-most blue wire is the earth.\nTest hookup of the lampizator. (traces are cut underneath the board to\nfree float the leg 11 of each DAC,\u00a0 so it is not innocent kind of\nreversible test.)\nAfter good result from the test, I went for full lampization, internal\ntubes, one per channel in anode follower mode - four triodes creating\nbalanced XLR outputs and RCA single ended too.\nI started by removing the main PCB and installing Trichord 4 clock.\nBelow you see the crystal, two caps and a resistor that had to be\nremoved (18 meg crystal, not typical 16 meg.)\nThe new clock connects to the legs 1 of the 74HCU04 chip (signal) and\nleg 7th - GND (see red lines).\nThe VRDS level two (middle) with composite bridge and cast alloy clamp\nflywheel. Much much better than the ugly cheap level 1 CMK4 mechanism\nfrom TEAC T1 (CD7)\nLaser assembly and pickup is Sony KSS151A on magnetic rails - again -\nvery decent laser.\nI simply love that PCB\nAs you see - this player has a transformer with dual primaries - 230\nand 120 VAC. Good for all continents.\nThe XLRs and RCAs are so good quality that they do not need to be\nreplaced. They can stay.\nThe power supply section houses a nice, big, potted and encapsulated\ntransformer. Very nice. There is provision for 230/120 selection. The\nraw supplies and rectifiers are heavy duty, oversized, and (whatever\nthat means) - FOR AUDIO. In my opinion that is BS because a cap can be\neither good or bad, but FOR AUDIO means nothing.\u00a0 Just marketing\nbuzzword.\nYou see the AUDIO caps and my new bolt for holding the transformer of\nlampizator.\nThis is empty space under the main PCB where all my new power supplies\nand filters will be located.\nNew transformer installed. I had two secondaries of 110 VAC so I used\nthem in dual mono config.\nA tube (two triodes) in balanced mode is ideally supplied from ons\ningle source. If positive signal causes one tube to draw current MORE,\nthe negative impulse causes the other half to draw EQUALLY LESS.\nSummary current demand is CONSTANT and this is very good.\nThis is main AC cable of TEAC with added parasitic Lampizator brown\ntwisted pair that is transformer primary.\nThis way the Lampizator is connected AFTER the switch, after filter of\nAC noise and after fuses as well.\nIn the central section of the player where the mechanism is located -\nthere is additional large power supply section with 4 gigantic caps and\nsome other stuff. So the main PCB gets very good power.\nAbove you see the SPDIF digitall output section.\u00a0 There is no\ntransformer for signal (good) and there is TOSLINK as well to the left.\nIt makes overall a nice transport, should you EVER want a DAC better\nthan internal AD1862.\nThe Lampizator power supplies are getting glued and wired together. On\nthe right - 12 V DC, on the left hand side - two high voltage anode\nsupplies (CRC filters and integrated bridges.\nThis is the resistor kit that goes on the socket. Two Cathode resistors\nof 200 Ohms and two grid resistors of 240K. The twisted end becomes\nsystem ground.\nLampizator circuit ready to go. Anode resistors are mounted away on\nanode supply caps output. This makes the triode socket less congested.\nAbove: all power supplies are glued to the floor under the main PCB.\nthe long black thing is the power switch extension rod.\nDark red resistors connected to red wires are anode resistors in anode\nfollower setup.\nThe tubes were mounted above main PCB after I removed the analog output\nstage - 8 op-amps and their capacitors. There was enough space for 2\ntubes.\nRed wires go to anodes of triodes. All grounds are connected together\nin star fashion: both tube grounds, RCA's, XLRs, anode supply ground,\nheater ground and main PCB ground.\nXLR and RCA inputs were floated from the\u00a0 PCB and freed.\nClock was powered from now un-used OPAMP supply of plus 12V DC (on the\ncopper rail.)\nSOUND of TEAC VRDS-25\nThe sound is\nright there with the top players. League zero - which stands for no\ncompromise, best CD playback under the sun. It is not a winner, but\ndefinitely in the same league as the best ones I tried.\nThe sound is overall the safest all rounder. Not as goose bump magical\nmidrange timbre as the TDA1541 players, not as thunderous superbass as\nWolfson, not as crystal clear trebles as Lampucera DAC CS4397, and not\nas deep deep hallucination as from BB-1794 of the Shanling CD300. But\nit has no flaws or\nfaults. Very highly recommended.\nThe tube: Russian 6H2P (6N2P) with SRPP and 200 Ohms in both cathodes.\nECC88 and E88CC works great as well.\n2 days later: a very enlightening listening session with a comparison\nbetween Audionote DAC 2 signature (2 x PCM63)\u00a0 driven by TEAC as a\ntransport versus\nTEAC lampized.

Under the federal grant agreement, those design-build contracts must be awarded by September 2012.Along the way, the state must submit detailed plans to federal officials for how right of way will be acquired, how roads and utilities will be moved, and how hazardous materials will be handled.But all of that still depends on funding, which is not yet pinned down and faces its own obstacles.Money mattersGov. Jerry Brown and the state Legislature must agree to allocate money from Prop. 1A to match the federal funds. Barker said the authority will seek its first installments of money in the state's 2012-13 budget.Prop. 1A requires that an independent panel of transportation and rail experts approve budget requests before any bonds are sold.The same panel late last year issued a report questioning the authority's lack of a detailed financing and income plan, lack of a business model for operating and managing the system, and lack of staffing to oversee the project.Some legislators also have criticized the authority's preliminary estimates of revenues and ridership as \"unrealistic.\" One example: a projection of as many as 102,700 riders daily on the statewide system, including 4,500 boardings daily in Fresno.\"Obviously there are challenges and questions, and the onus is on us to address those questions,\" Barker said. \"By the time we bring our budget request, we'll have to have all these questions answered.\"Should the Legislature reject the budget request, \"that would be saying, 'No, we don't want high-speed rail,' \" Barker added. \"That would be telling the federal government to take back the $2.5 billion and saying we don't want it.\"If the armful of \"ifs\" are accomplished -- if the rail authority meets the deadline for environmental review, if it gets money from the Legislature, and if it awards construction contracts in time -- then it's on to the dirty work.Shovels in the groundThe rail authority suggests that building the segments between Merced and Bakersfield will create as many as 80,000 temporary construction jobs between 2012 and 2017.But because only 30% of the engineering is expected to be completed on the project by the time contracts are awarded next year, much work will remain on the drawing board until perhaps 2013 and 2014.\"We won't have 10,000 hard hats on the ground laying rail in September 2012,\" said Barker. \"Final engineering will be the first phase of work being done.\"The first work that the public would see is likely to be land acquisition, clearing property and demolishing structures in the path of the tracks, said John Popoff, an engineer on the authority's management team.\nPrevious PageNext Page\nThe reporter can be reached at tsheehan@fresnobee.com or (559) 441-6319.\nSimilar stories:\nHigh-speed rail project likely delayed until 2013\nHigh-speed rail project likely delayed until 2013\nConstruction of a high-speed train line in the central San Joaquin Valley was supposed to start late this year.

By 16 he was in prison for the first time, but not the last. His life was playing out on the fringes of society, characterized by rebellion and aggression. Change seemed unlikely until he happened upon the film set of Roar, a movie featuring Hollywood actress Tippi Hedren (The Birds) and her daughter, Melanie Griffith, as well as a variety of lions, pumas, tigers and elephants. Chriswas immediately fascinated by Timbo, the gigantic bull elephant known for its misbehavior, and applied for a job as an elephant trainer on the small ranch that was its home. To win Timbo's trust, Chris chained himself up in the elephant's enclosure and tossed away the key. It was the start of a 30-year relationship that would tame the savage in Chris.\nPowerful photos capture the essence of elephant man Chris Gallucci's life: the small world of the ranch, walks with Timbo on the edge of the Mojave Desert, his training regime with the huge bull. Extracts from Chris's diary provide a window into his soul.\nElephant Man inspires with the silent power of an intense spiritual connection between animal and man.\nNomi Baumgartl is an internationally acclaimed photographer specializing in images that show the connection between man and nature. Her work has received prestigious awards, and her pictures are frequently published and exhibited.\nChris Gallucci, author, biker and elephant trainer, lives in Acton, California. Since Timbo's death, Chris has continued to work as preserve supervisor at Shambala, the wild animal reserve on the edge of the Mojave Desert.\nDaniel Opitz is an award-winning filmmaker and founder of Ocean Mind, an independent film, photo and television production company. His work includes The Elephant Man (also called Tusks and Tattoos), which has been shown worldwide at film festivals and on television (Animal Planet).\nSorry, no table of contents exists for this entry.\nForeword by Daniel Opitz\n\"I love you\" and \"I could kill you.\" The world the Elephant Man grew up in was mean and hard. He left home when he was only twelve. Throughout his teens he was involved with the violent biker culture that developed in and around Los Angeles in the late sixties. Thanks to a falsified ID and too much pride to admit it, he found himself in jail for the first time at the tender age of seventeen.\nHis only true philosophy in those days was to show no weakness. While this mantra fueled the flames of his rebellion and brought him nothing but trouble, it also led to his eventual salvation: Timbo was a five-ton grey giant, who at nearly fifty years of age was North America's biggest and oldest African elephant bull. As stubborn as Chris himself, he too was unpredictable, fearless and always ready for a fight.\nChris was not looking for anything more than a job and perhaps some excitement when he rode his chopper into Acton, California, a small town on the edge of the Mojave Desert in 1975. He found a job as a welder on the insane set of the movie Roar, which starred over 100 wild lions, cougars, tigers and two elephants, as well as Hollywood diva and Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren and her daughter Melanie Griffith.\nWhen filming was completed, Chris and Tippi stayed behind with the wild animals. Together they converted what was left of the movie set into \"Shambala -- The Roar Foundation,\" a non-profit organization dedicated to providing the animals the best life possible. Chris, who was drawn to gigantic Timbo from the very start, asked if he could be the elephant's new trainer. He got the job.\nTo understand what it felt like to be an elephant, Chris spent the first night with Timbo, attaching himself to Timbo's chain and throwing away the key. To gain Timbo's trust, Chris learned to control his own demons. \"See,\" he says, \"The more relaxed and at ease I am, the more I allow Timbo to be free.\" In the nearly 30 years they spent together, neither Chris nor Timbo got into serious trouble again.\nYou do not come across people like Chris Gallucci simply by chance; you get caught in their gravitational field. Chris and I got to know each other in the Bahamas in 2000, during a photo shoot with Nomi Baumgartl. A model had invited him along for his first vacation in nearly 30 years. After just a few days, however, Chris cut his Caribbean trip short. He simply could not bear the thought that due to his absence, Timbo would be again be confined and chained. Chris returned to his own small world and self-imposed prison at Shambala.\nI have always been drawn to people who have pushed the envelope throughout their lives, personalities who thrive on enormous challenge. A year later, when I arrived in Shambala with my film crew to document \"The Elephant Man,\" Chris was in the midst of a huge personal crisis. For the first time he regretted his lonely life, confined to a ranch in the desert with Timbo. He shaved his long beard, sold his beloved chopper and stopped polishing his meticulously sharpened knives. But Chris would not be Chris if he did not manage to pull himself out of this deep depression. As filming progressed, he gradually found his balance again. He started his journal again, grew his beard back and bought a new motorcycle and a '57 Chevy Bel Air that he had always wanted. We finished the film and became fast friends.\nI valued Chris' simplicity, his attitude and way of looking at things, his entire essence, even Chris just being Chris. He never seemed to need such modern amenities as credit cards, computers or cell phones. Not because he was adverse to them, but because he was busy with other more important things. To me, he represented a sort of primal creature with an instinctive kind of wisdom and yes, an undertone of aggression. In a strange way, Chris became for me what Timbo was to him.\nWhen photographer Nomi Baumgartl gets involved with a new subject it is not only with her camera, but also with her heart and entire being. Nomi was part of our film crew in Shambala. At one point she found herself in the middle of a fallow field with a five-ton elephant hurtling toward her. \"Don't move!\" Chris shouted, \"Don't move!\" Nomi closed her eyes and all was still. Suddenly she felt a moist, warm trunk in her face, and a suction so strong it felt as if she was being sucked into a wind tunnel. \"Now he trusts you.\" At that moment she experienced the wondrous spiritual link between man and animal, Chris and Timbo.\nElephant Man is the inspiring story of how a wild animal tamed a wild man. Told through potent pictures and diary excerpts, it reflects on the powerful bond that can occur between humans and animals. Elephant Man describes their training regimen, walks through the fields together and the author's pleasure in watching Timbo play in the water.\n- Katy Scope\u00a0\u00a0Katy Lifestyles & Homes\u00a0\u00a02009 06\nElephant Man is an intriguing diary of two stubborn individuals with personality. It is a remarkable, if somewhat insane story that will keep you coming back.\n- Randy Midzain\u00a0\u00a0Winnipeg Free Press\u00a0\u00a02008 12 07\nThis is a story of redemption, of how a difficult animal made a human being out of a man.\n- Bill Robertson\u00a0\u00a0Saskatoon Star Phoenix\u00a0\u00a02008 12 13\n[Gallucci's] diary forms most of the text, though Baumgartl's sensitive and moving photographs--of both man and beast--are the book's core.\n- \u00a0\u00a0The Globe and Mail\u00a0\u00a02008 12 06\nAnimal lovers will cherish this love story between Chris Gallucci, an ex-biker, and Timbo, a five-ton grey African elephant bull.... Baumgard's photographs of the two show an amazing similarity in their eyes, facial wrinkles, even their expressions. These photos show less wildness in Gallucci than intelligence and sensitivity to Timbo. Some close ups could easily be of either one.

We\u2019re told there are horses in heaven (Revelation 6:2-8; 19:11). In fact, there are lots of horses, enough for the vast armies of heaven to ride (Revelation 19:11; 2 Kings 6:17).\nOther animals aren\u2019t mentioned in the Revelation passages, presumably because they don\u2019t play a role in Christ\u2019s second coming (an army bringing deliverance rides horses, not Dalmatians or hedgehogs). But isn\u2019t it likely that since there are innumerable horses in heaven there are all kinds of other animals too? Why wouldn\u2019t there be? Why would we expect horses to be the only animals? If there were no other animals, there wouldn\u2019t be horses.\nIn Isaiah 65:17 God refers to creating a New Heavens and a New Earth. In subsequent verses the text seems to move back and forth from the millennial kingdom to the New Earth. God makes clear he will have animals living there\u2013either in the millennium or the New Earth or both (Isaiah 65:25).\nSome also argue for animals being in heaven based on Ecclesiastes 3:19-21, which says \u201cMan\u2019s fate is like that of the animals...all go to the same place.\u201d However, in the larger context of Ecclesiastes Solomon is simply talking about the outward appearance of death. Men and animals both die and we can\u2019t see where they go. Scripture tells us elsewhere, however, that man has an eternal soul. It tells us he goes one of two places at death. Animals are not said to have eternal souls. They are not said to relocate when they die. The presumption would be that at death they cease to exist.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean beloved animals won\u2019t be in heaven. I once read Billy Graham\u2019s response to a little girl\u2019s question, \u201cWill my dog who died this week be in heaven?\u201d Graham replied, \u201cIf it would make you any happier, then yes, he will be.\u201d Animals aren\u2019t nearly as valuable as people, but God is their maker and has touched many people\u2019s lives through them. It would be simple for Him to recreate a pet in heaven. I see no reason to believe he wouldn\u2019t if it would bring his children pleasure.\nRomans 8:18-22 says that the whole creation was subject to suffering and futility because of human sin. The creation groans in longing for the liberation that will come to humans, and thereby to all creation itself. Creation is under man\u2019s dominion and will share the rewards of his redemption just as it shared the punishment for his sin. Animals are a central part of that creation, next to man himself the most significant part. After all, besides his wife, Adam was called upon to give names only to one other part of the creation\u2013the animals (Genesis 2:19-20). He worked the garden, but he wasn\u2019t invited to name the vegetation. Clearly, the animals had certain qualities that set them above other creation. They were to be special to man, and his naming them makes his connection with them personal.\nIf the New Earth is all the best of the old earth and more, then we should expect it to contain animals. If animals weren\u2019t part of the New Earth, this would seem an obvious oversight. Eden was ruined through sin and will be restored through Christ\u2019s reign of righteousness. All that was part of Eden, and then made wrong through the sin of the first Adam, we would expect to be part of the New Earth, made right through the virtue of the Second Adam.\nWould God take away from us in heaven what he gave, for delight and companionship and help, to Adam and Eve in Eden? Would he revoke his earlier decision to put animals with man, and under man\u2019s care? If he remakes the New Earth with new men (who look very much like the old men, only perfect), wouldn\u2019t we expect him also to make new animals (who will presumably look like the old animals, only perfect)?\nFor more information on the subject of Heaven, see Randy Alcorn\u2019s book Heaven\n", "index": [[1624, 1630], [1714, 1720], [1775, 1782], [1821, 1827], [1829, 1839], [1936, 1946], [1956, 1961], [2007, 2017], [2073, 2079], [2417, 2423], [2430, 2433], [2473, 2482], [2578, 2587], [2589, 2592], [2671, 2680], [2690, 2696], [2758, 2770], [2792, 2795], [3029, 3038], [3370, 3382], [3470, 3476], [3593, 3596], [3798, 3804], [4259, 4263], [4346, 4353], [4611, 4620], [4740, 4749], [4789, 4793], [4846, 4852], [4900, 4904], [4955, 4959], [4995, 5004], [5043, 5054], [5062, 5065], [5151, 5163], [5167, 5171], [5275, 5284], [5501, 5507], [5533, 5539]], "wikipedia_ids": [30701025, 503224, 4380, 30701025, 4379, 4379, 4380, 4379, 1095706, 15088, 5042765, 27132425, 27132425, 5042765, 27132425, 15088, 9910, 15822899, 23410414, 690865, 690865, 5042765, 521555, 35330199, 12667, 27132425, 27132425, 13078, 1095706, 13078, 35330199, 27132425, 35330199, 5042765, 11473533, 13078, 27132425, 30701025, 30701025], "wikipedia_titles": ["Heaven in Christianity", "Elijah (oratorio)", "Books of Kings", "Heaven in Christianity", "Book of Revelation", "Book of Revelation", "Books of Kings", "Book of Revelation", "Jesus", "Isaiah", "God", "New Earth (Christianity)", "New Earth (Christianity)", "God", "New Earth (Christianity)", "Isaiah", "Ecclesiastes", "Man", "Religious text", "Billy Graham", "Billy Graham", "God", "Ancient Rome", "Last Adam", "Book of Genesis", "New Earth (Christianity)", "New Earth (Christianity)", "Garden of Eden", "Jesus", "Garden of Eden", "Last Adam", "New Earth (Christianity)", "Last Adam", "God", "Adam and Eve", "Garden of Eden", "New Earth (Christianity)", "Heaven in Christianity", "Heaven in Christianity"]}

I am a shoemaker and my children have no shoes.\nI\u2019ve been working in the Internet since 1996, but my daughter, at 11, is clearly the last one in her class to get an email. Opening that Pandora\u2019s Box is something that I push off month to month, day to day, hour to hour. Now, at long last, a teacher is requiring that all six graders have an email. It\u2019s almost Halloween and we have not yet bowed down to the edict.\nIf you\u2019re scared of email for your kids, there are surprisingly few resources. If you want them to play more games, there are a million walled gardens all willing to take your money. There are lots of filters for internet use, Net Nanny and Apple\u2019s built-in parental controls among them. And, there are plenty of kiddy email sites that allow your infant a happy place to click on lots of letters without messing up the computer too much, and these progress up to age 8, 9, or maybe 10. But if you have waited until your daughter is almost 12 to give her an email, she will cry, as mine did, when you suggest she go to a site called Zilladog to access her email.\nSo, it\u2019s a sorry state, but we\u2019ll likely get her a Gmail account and monitor it ourselves until she is a bit older. I\u2019m not overjoyed by this, but my baby is growing up.\nStill, there are some parental tasks left to do, and first among them is choosing a screen name. There is nothing I could find online on this, except for one thin forum post on choosing a screen name. So here is what I\u2019ve come up with as a guideline for my daughter:\n1. No real names. She can use a nickname or some random word, but nothing that identifies her personally.\n2. No ID that she\u2019s a girl. So no girlygirl@gmail.com. This doesn\u2019t surprise her at all for some reason and I\u2019m happy I don\u2019t have to explain why I\u2019m being careful.\n3. No years, like her birth year or the current year so that she isn\u2019t marked by a certain era. Plus adding 123 after your chosen name is so AOL circa 1999.\nUnfortunately, with over 2 billion internet users (Nielsen March 2011) and who knows how many on gmail, almost any combo of words is already taken until you get into phrases that are out of common usage.\nStill, the rules are in place and we may have to keep searching a bit together. Otherwise, she can start using her new email : elephantupstaircase@gmail.com as early as tonight.\nPopularity: 1%\nPaid online access to New York Times \u2013 my opinion\nAuthor\nPaul Banas Submitted: 01.21.10\n0 Comments\nAs a publisher, I\u2019m happy to see the New York Times take a real lead on paid content. I\u2019ve always thought that the Web wants to be \u201cFREE,\u201d but everyone knows that anything that is always given away free turns into garbage. And that\u2019s the road most print publications are on unless they change their model. The New York Times can\u2019t continue to create leadership journalism as it watches home delivery and newsstand sales dwindle to those few remaining octogenarians who want the inky, bulky broadsheet hanging into their cereal (Full disclosure: I\u2019m one of them). While Google AdSense can make publishers a few dimes and nickels each month, it\u2019s revenue potential is way over-stated and decreasing. There has to be another way.\nI love the NYT solution for the following reasons:\n1. It provides a benefit and distinction for home subscribers. Part of this reaction is selfish, since I\u2019ve subscribed since I lived in New York fifteen years ago. But it stands to reason that you promote sales by giving benefits to the people who increase your value as an asset. And, advertisers like to see paid subscription since it connotes involvement.\n2. It allows people to get a little bit for free. They haven\u2019t yet said how many articles per month you will get for \u201cfree\u201d as a non-subscriber, but it\u2019s at least ten, that should give you enough to read your favorite columnists or features every month. Beyond that, as with public radio, you really should be donating something anyway.\n3. It keeps the NYT open to Google and Bing searches. I always thought this was the way things should go. Allow the NYT to be searchable via search engines so people can find the best info online and perhaps discover the Times.\n4. Most importantly, it still allows bloggers to tell the world about stories they find in the NYT, without resorting to copying articles wholesale. I often make a comment on an article, providing an interesting snipped with a link to the full article. The NYT will still allow this though clicking the link will count towards the monthly quota for unpaid users. This should help the New York Time get more readers while not destroying their model.\nThis is the system the New Yorker should use as well. It\u2019s fun to send an great article to someone who is not a reader. It\u2019s not good if someone is reading the whole thing on line while everyone else is paying. And face it, a new generation of readers is growing up and they are happy reading a book or magazine on an iPhone rather than a physical magazine.\nHats off to the New York Times.\nPopularity: 1%\nTop internet searches for kids identified \u2013 \u201cSex\u201d and \u201cPorn\u201d near the top of lists\nAuthor\nPaul Banas Submitted: 01.20.10\n0 Comments\nWhat were kids most interested in and curious about in 2009? Parents can tell a lot from monitoring internet searches, which may also alert them to possible topics they may need to discuss with their kids. On a more macro level, Norton has identified the top searches conducted by kids in 2009 through data from OnlineFamily.Norton, a free family safety service that parents can use to protect kids online.\nDo You Know What Your Kids Are Looking For Online?\nNorton looked at the top 100 searches conducted by kids age 18 and under and also broke down results by age and gender. Some of the top terms may surprise parents. \u201cSex\u201d and \u201cPorn\u201d made it to the top overall search terms for both Teens group and \u201cSex\u201d for the Tweens group. These terms should raise a red flag to parents if they haven\u2019t had \u201cThe Talk\u201d with their children about content that may not be appropriate for kids. Kids\u2019 top three overall search terms in 2009 were YouTube, Google, and Facebook. While these sites can be entertaining and educational for kids under supervision, parents need to monitor usage and talk to kids about appropriate and inappropriate things they may find on-line.\nTeens\u2019 Top 25\n1.

When they are logged into their account, Safari only allows them to surf to sites we\u2019ve approved. We don\u2019t allow them to look at YouTube and other sites without us being there to control the buttons. Our kids are still only 5 and 9 so that is bound to change soon.\nNorton offers the basic OnlineFamily.Norton at no charge, but plans to launch a premium subscription version later in 2010.\nPopularity: 9%\nWhy parenting magazines ignore us dads\nAuthor\nPaul Banas Submitted: 10.21.09\n0 Comments\nIt\u2019s true most parenting magazines have mom-free names and try to insert a page or two \u201cjust for dad,\u201d but the reason the overwhelming amount of content is geared toward the female persuasion has a lot less to do with the editors than it does the people who are paying to get the magazine out the door: the advertisers.\nSorry Dad \u2013 but they don\u2019t care if you want five friendly recipes for adding veggies to your kid\u2019s diet. They want to sell your wife/girlfriend a package of organic waffles with broccoli ground up inside. Because the studies show she\u2019s the one more likely to buy them. Women are widely touted as the controllers of the family purse strings \u2013 even in families where there are shared checking accounts. The common number you hear? About eighty percent of family spending is done by the female head of household.\nFrom Why Parenting Mags Ignore Dad | Strollerderby]\nBad news for those of us trying at least to cover the cost of the Pampers by writing about our dad experiences. Until we become a real economic force, dads are an add-on. But why is that when dads are involved, or usually lead, the very big ticket items, like the choice of the mini van or the new long-term life insurance plan.\nAs I mentioned a few posts back, this year at the ABC Kids show in Vegas, \u201cdad\u201d was integrated into all the marketing materials. Maybe dad isn\u2019t doing the weekly shopping but he is weighing in heavily on which stroller he is willing to push down the street, or which car seat he\u2019s going to move in and out of the car. Dads do think differently than moms, and the sexes will likely continue to have their own sweet spots and obsessions, but count on more and more dads to be making the choice of the family toothpaste and even the diapers as we take a more active role in \u201chome\u201d and even stay there to be with the kids.\nPopularity: 1%\nHelp for helpless dads (and moms) with no support system, but lots of cash\nAuthor\nPaul Banas Submitted: 10.16.09\n0 Comments\nFinally someone has come up with the ultimate service for new parents who have no time, no clue, but lots of coin. Gifted At Birth (giftedatbirth.com) sends you everything you need to take care of baby every week, for three months after the baby is born.\nThey\u2019ll even help you choose the right items for your lifestyle (green, idiot-proof\u2026.).

Index, selected bibliography, notes, unillustrated.\nConventional wisdom has it that international terrorism is biggest enemy of peace today. But when attempting to define terrorism, forget the stereotype of a masked bomber. In Lebanon, for instance, Hezbollah is a recognized political party whose members have been elected to the Lebanese Parliament in a free and open election, yet such world powers as the United States and Britain label it as a terrorist organization.\nCarr, a British journalist and broadcaster, ranges back in time to the 1880s to profile the history of terrorism. Included in this narrative sweep are the attack by Russian revolutionaries upon Tsar Alexander II in St. Petersburg, the African vengeance of the Mau Maus, the Palestine Liberation Organization, Basque separatists and Ireland's IRA.\nRather than merely hanging labels around the necks of one's political enemies,\u00a0 Carr believes it's more useful to examine the root causes of terrorism. \"The present eruption of Islamist violence is perhaps a symptom of an imbalance of power,\" he says, \"and the consequence of decades of manipulation, deceit and hypocrisy in Western foreign policy towards the Arab world.\" This is a work unlikely to show up on George W. Bush's reading list.\nPosted by Steve | Permalink\nTrackBack\nTrackBack URL for this entry:http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341c5e4553ef00e0098992338833\nListed below are links to weblogs that reference Book Alert / The Infernal Machine -- A History of Terrorism:\nContact Us\nHistory Wire welcomes your feedback.

What can we do?\nRead full question\nWe found a company that will refinance our first, but the second lien holder will not subordinate without a full appraisal. We have already paid them $150 and they won't return it even though they didn't do the subordination. What department within the second mortgage company would we write to request a loan rate reduction? If they refuse to reduce the interest rate, what other recourse would we have? Can we offer a settlement of 10 cents on the dollar? I noticed several other people in your comments have been able to do this. We live in Colorado.\nBills.com Resident Expert\nDec 12, 2011\nBILL'S ANSWER\nAs part of its efforts to stimulate the US economy, the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates to record low levels in 2008 and 2009, which in part has allowed banks to offer some attractive rates to homeowners wishing to take out a new mortgage or refinance an existing loan.\nRefinancing when the loan balances exceed the property value\nAlthough many current homeowners would like to refinance their home loans to take advantage of the low interest rates, the downturn in property values has resulted in many owing second mortgages or home equity loans that push their total current financing perilously close to, if not over, the actual values of their homes. In this situation, a refinance lender is unlikely to loan the homeowner enough money to combine the first and second mortgages into a single obligation, as the lender does not want to extend a loan that exceeds the value of the property securing debt.\nThe refi lender may be willing to refinance the first mortgage, but only if the lender holding the second mortgage or home equity loan is willing to give the refi lender's encumbrance on the property seniority over the second mortgage.\nAllow me to travel on a momentary tangent regarding legal terminology. In Colorado, California, Texas and 18 other states the \"mortgage\" is actually a \"deed of trust.\" Legally, the two are different, but a comparison of the two exceeds the scope of this discussion. Although it is inaccurate technically to call a Colorado home loan a mortgage, we will continue to refer to the first and second loan on the property here a mortgage because that is expected and understood by our non-property lawyer readers.\nSubordination\nGetting back to the subordination issue, without such an agreement, the second mortgage, as the older debt, would become the senior encumbrance on the property once the refi lender pays off the first mortgage as part of the refinance.\nUnfortunately, unless you have a significant equity cushion, the bank holding your second mortgage loan is likely to refuse to agree to subordinate its encumbrance, especially if you are planning to \"cash out\" any of your equity by borrowing more from the refi lender than you currently owe on the first mortgage.\nThe secondary lender's position is already relatively weak in terms of its ability to enforce its security interest in the home, since it would be required to either pay off or otherwise receive the first mortgage lender's consent to proceed with foreclosure. Given its already tenuous ability to force repayment, the secondary lender is unlikely to agree to subordination to a \"cash out\" refi loan, which would eat up the small amount of equity to which it may be able to lay claim in case of default.\nOn the other hand, if you can show the second mortgage holder that the refi loan will actually reduce the risk of default on your home loans by reducing your total mortgage payments each month, you may find the secondary lender more willing to cooperate with you and the bank providing the refinance loan.\nConsult with the agent handling your potential refinance loan, as well as any other mortgage professionals you know, to discuss the best way to present your plan to the second mortgage lender. The key is making the lender believe that the refinance loan and required subordination will ultimately serve its interests.\nAppraisal by second mortgage company\nIn your question, you state that your second mortgage company has requested a full appraisal of your property before it will consider agreeing to subjugate its encumbrance to that of the company through which you are trying to refinance your first mortgage.\nFirst, you should understand that demanding a complete appraisal of the home's value is not unusual. The second mortgage company wants to determine how much equity you currently have in the property (the more equity, the more likely junior encumbrances will be paid in case of foreclosure), and how the proposed refinance loan will affect this equity cushion. It will also want to determine if you are \"upside-down\" on the property (you owe more that the home is worth), as being in this position significantly increases the possibility that you will default on one or all of your mortgage obligations.\nHere, it sounds like the lender has refused to subordinate, and refused to refund the appraisal fee paid. Unfortunately, I do not think that you have much recourse in this regard, as appraisal fees are usually non-refundable.\nHowever, if you think that you were mislead by the lender, you may want to contact the Colorado Dept. of Real Estate and the Colorado Attorney General's Office to file complaints against the lender. While these agencies cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, they are often successful in mediating disputes between consumers and businesses.\nLoan modification\nYou are correct in pointing out that a Bills.com reader reported that a second mortgage holder made a lump-sum settlement with a homeowner for 10 cents on the dollar. Keep in mind that there are dozens of companies making second mortgage loans, and hundreds of thousands of second mortgages under contract. Your lender may not offer such attractive settlement terms.\nAs for what department at the second mortgage company you need to contact to discuss the possible modification of your loan terms (payment amount, interest rate, loan term, etc.), you should probably start by contacting the general customer service department. They may help you directly, but a good CS agent should be able to point you to the correct department (probably named something like \"loss mitigation,\" though this will depend on your specific lender).\nTo read more about refinance loans, I invite you to visit the Bills.com home refinance page.

We are completely moved into our new home at 1531 Dickey Drive. The Theology and Ethics building is a five-story, LEED-certified green building with fantastic natural light, spacious offices and classrooms, and all of the latest technology. The Theology building is over twice the size of the old Bishops Hall, and yet uses less electrical power! Woohoo!!!\nHere are some highlights of the week:\nMondayStudents checked in for pre-orientation, taking care of IDs and parking passes, configuring laptops, and tidying up financial aid matters. Some thoughts and themes heard as people anticipate starting seminary include: excited, anxious and excited, wondering how classes are going to be after being out of school for ten years, nervous, happy to be in Atlanta, looking forward to classes starting, and not feeling\nready for the summer to be over.\nTuesdayThM and MTS students spent Tuesday around campus, meeting with Dr. Steve Kraftchick and their advisors, touring the Candler and Emory campuses and libraries, and finished up with night swimming and dinner at Drs. Medi Volpe and Lewis Ayres\u2018 house. No doubt St. Augustine was on the menu.\nWednesdayMDiv students were on campus for orientation. Chapel service was led by Rev. Dr. Joel LeMon, Asstistant Professor of Old Testament. The Scripture text was from Psalm 119\u2013a 176-verse acrostic poem and the longest chapter in the Bible\u2013and Dr. Lemon had the entire chapel chanting the Hebrew alphabet from Aleph to Tav while exploring the He verses (33-40) which emphasize God\u2019s movement in our lives. (A side note: I sat in the west balcony of Cannon Chapel, where I have sat many times before, but for the first time noticed the similarities between Paul Rudolph\u2018s square design (see right, view from the west balcony) and the design of the Frank Lloyd Wright\u2018s Unity Temple (below, view from east balcony) in Oak Park, IL. Both have wonderful natural light filling the worship spaces from above, seating in-the-round, long vertical elements, and a great square pillar of space in the center. Wright\u2019s Temple is more symetrical, orderly, and rectilinear while Rudolph\u2019s Chapel is flowing, raw, and spiraling\u2013both are great and unique spaces.\nThursdayMDiv students heard about the new curriculum from Dr. Gail O\u2019Day and other faculty members. Worship was led by Rev. Dr. Teresa Fry Brown.

The objective of this study was to investigate the antineoplastic activity of NM, a novel antineoplastic nutrient mixture (containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid and green tea extract) that demonstrates a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against a number of human cancer cell lines, on human FAHNSCC in vitro and in vivo.\nMethods and Materials: Human FAHNSCC cell line OHSU-974 (Fanconi Anemia Research Fund, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA) was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% FBS and antibiotics. At near confluence, cells were treated in triplicate with different concentrations of NM: 0, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 \u00b5g/ml. Cells were also treated with PMA to induce MMP-9 activity. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, secretion of MMPs by gelatinase zymography, invasion through Matrigel and morphology by H&E staining. In vivo, athymic male nude mice (n=12) were inoculated with 3x106 OHSU-974 cells subcutaneously and randomly divided into two groups: group A was fed a regular diet and group B a regular diet supplemented with 1% NM. Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed and their tumors were excised, weighed and processed for histology.\nResults: NM inhibited the growth of OHSU-974 tumor by 48% and tumor burden by 50%. At lower concentrations, NM demonstrated no effect on proliferation, but at 1000 \u00b5g/ml showed 40% toxicity. Zymography revealed MMP-2 and PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion. NM suppressed secretion of both MMPs in a dose-dependent manner, with virtual inhibition at 500 \u00b5g/ml. NM inhibited OHSU-974 invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent fashion with total block at 1000 \u00b5g/ml. H&E staining showed no morphological changes below 500 \u00b5g/ml.\nConclusions:The results suggest that NM has potential therapeutic use in the treatment of human FA HNSCC.\nComment\nCurrent treatment methods for Fanconi Anemia-associated cancers are generally ineffective. Thus, there is a need for development of effective therapeutic agents for these cancers with minimal toxicity. Our studies demonstrated that NM significantly inhibited the growth and tumor burden of FA HNSCC cell line OHSU-974 in vivo. In addition, invasive parameters, such as OHSU-974 cell line MMP-2 and -9 secretion and invasion were significantly inhibited by NM in vitro. These findings suggest potential of NM\n", "index": [[1874, 1883], [1885, 1890], [2039, 2053], [2055, 2057], [2245, 2249], [2369, 2371], [2460, 2462], [2798, 2832], [2834, 2842], [2844, 2850], [2852, 2855], [2873, 2877], [2907, 2910], [3014, 3016], [3149, 3152], [3173, 3177], [3221, 3229], [3248, 3251], [3328, 3332], [3475, 3477], [3599, 3601], [3698, 3700], [3781, 3791], [3801, 3806], [3840, 3842], [3872, 3876], [3943, 3945], [3956, 3964], [3982, 3990], [4051, 4054], [4150, 4152], [4257, 4271], [4459, 4461], [4596, 4604], [4615, 4620], [4683, 4685], [4732, 4734]], "wikipedia_ids": [68187, 26667, 437943, 437943, 1209545, 437943, 21649, 1655072, 23503, 26811621, 3434750, 1303531, 669931, 21649, 1009869, 507329, 2329720, 3255718, 1655072, 21649, 21649, 21649, 1634427, 13621723, 21649, 507329, 21649, 1655072, 2329720, 3255718, 21649, 437943, 21649, 1655072, 13621723, 21649, 21649], "wikipedia_titles": ["FC Barcelona", "Spain", "Fanconi anemia", "Fanconi anemia", "Head", "Fanconi anemia", "New Mexico", "Oregon Health & Science University", "Portland, Oregon", "Oregon", "United States", "Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center", "NCAA Division I", "New Mexico", "MTT assay", "Matrix metalloproteinase", "Matrigel", "H&E stain", "Oregon Health & Science University", "New Mexico", "New Mexico", "New Mexico", "Zymography", "MMP2", "New Mexico", "Matrix metalloproteinase", "New Mexico", "Oregon Health & Science University", "Matrigel", "H&E stain", "New Mexico", "Fanconi anemia", "New Mexico", "Oregon Health & Science University", "MMP2", "New Mexico", "New Mexico"]}

Like TH Huxley, he was motivated by profoundly democratic impulses to communicate science to the public. \u201cScience is too important,\u201d he said, paraphrasing Clemenceau, \u201cto be left to the scientists.\u201d It will never be known how many practicing scientists today, in how many countries, owe their initial inspiration to a book, article, or short story by Isaac Asimov\u2014nor how many ordinary citizens are sympathetic to the scientific enterprise from the same cause. For example, Marvin Minsky of MIT, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, was brought to his subject by Asimov's robot stories (initially conceived to illustrate human/robot partnerships and to counter the prevailing notion, going back to Frankenstein, of robots as necessarily malign). At a time when science fiction was mainly devoted to action and adventure, Asimov introduced puzzle-solving schemes that taught science and thinking along the way.\nA number of his phrases and ideas have insinuated themselves into the culture of science\u2014for example, his spare description of the solar system as \u201cfour planets plus debris\u201d and his notion of one day carrying icebergs from the rings of Saturn to the arid wastelands of Mars. He wrote many science books for young people, and as editor of his own science-fiction magazine he made efforts to encourage young writers.\nHis output was prodigious, approaching 500 volumes, always in his characteristic straightforward, plain-speaking syntax. Part of the reason his Foundation series on the decline of a galactic empire worked so well is that it was based on a close reading of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: A principal theme was the effort to keep science alive as the Dark Ages rolled in.\nAsimov spoke out in favor of science and reason and against pseudoscience and superstition. He was not afraid to criticize the US government and was deeply committed to stabilizing world population growth.\nThe microscopic probe he described in his novel Fantastic Voyage\u2014which could enter the human bloodstream and repair tissue damage\u2014was, sadly, not yet available at the time of his death. As someone born in grinding poverty, and with a lifelong passion to write and explain, Asimov by his own standards led a successful and happy life. In one of his last books he wrote: \u201cMy life has just about run its course and I don't really expect to live much longer.\u201d However, he went on, his love for his wife, the psychiatrist Janet Jeppson, and hers for him, sustained him. \u201cIt's been a good life, and I am satisfied with it. So please don't worry about me.\u201d\nI don't. Instead, I worry about the rest of us, with no Isaac Asimov around to inspire the young to learning and to science.\nCarl Sagan\nCarl Sagan was a science popularizer, co-creator and host of Cosmos, and author or co-author of many books including The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark.\nResources\nCSI Store\nSkeptical Organizations in the United States\nInternational Network of Skeptical Organizations\nCenters for Inquiry\nFree \u2018I Doubt It\u2019 Decal\nCFI Forums\nPublications\nSubscribe\nSkeptical Inquirer\nArchive\nLatest Issue\nSkeptical Briefs\nLatest Issue\nSpecial Articles\nGuide for Authors\nNews\nEvents\nPress Coverage\nPress Releases\nRecent Announcements\nAbout\nAbout CSI\nContact\nCSI Fellows and Staff\nDonate to CSI\nEducating Youth\nPrivacy Policy\nThe Pantheon of Skeptics\nContent copyright CSI or the respective copyright holders.

During a crater visit on 13 November no precursors were\nobserved, and on 18 November only background seismicity was\nrecorded by the CNGN station (500 m E of the crater).\nEarly phase of activity, 19-22 November. Local residents first\nnoticed explosions about the time of the onset of 30 minutes of\nmildly increasing seismicity detected by the CNGN station at 1145\non 19 November. Following a pause, seismicity continued to gain\nstrength. Increasing activity was reported that afternoon by\nresidents in Malpaisillo (~10 km N). Observations on the night of\n19-20 November indicated mild Strombolian activity, with vertically\ndirected ejecta, that was gradually increasing in strength. A\nNotice to Airmen (NOTAM) was issued the next day warning aviators\nof the volcanic activity.\nEruption tremor amplitude increased continuously and saturated the\nCNGN station (60 dB gain) at 0200 on the 21st. Tremor was detected\non short-period seismic stations within a 30 km radius (at San\nCristobal and Momotombo volcanoes, and near the city of Leon).\nEnergy release increased continuously and tremor could be felt over\n1 km away, when sitting down, as a smooth rocking motion.\nAt 2000 on 21 November incandescent bombs were being thrown up to\n300-400 m above the 1992 crater rim. Ash content was low compared\nwith the 1992 and May-August 1995 activity, and bombs were often\nvery large (meters across), which deformed and broke up in flight.\nBecause of near-vertical trajectories, few bombs fell outside the\ncrater. The new cone being built within the 1992 crater (figure 1)\nhad a steep (>45 degrees) basal scarp, 2-5 m high, followed by a\nlevel bench and then a less steep slope (25 degrees) to its crater.\nEjecta pulses maintained a frequency of 20/minute, but the size and\nduration of each pulse varied. From 0255 to 0310 on 22 November\nejecta heights were <150 m but ash content and degassing were much\nhigher, emitting dark clouds with each explosion. A thick, white\nlower plume appeared to be escaping from a new lava dome in the\n1992 crater, 50 m W of the new cone (figure 1). By 0500 the\neruption had regained previous intensity levels and exhibited\nnear-constant fire-fountain-like activity, bombs were larger, and\npulse frequency increased to 22/minute. The eruption continued at\nthis level for over 4 hours.\nThe new cone had almost reached the lip of the 1992 crater by 0700\non 22 November. At that time the lava dome emitted a small lava\nflow, 2-5 m wide and 50 m long, that followed the edge of the new\ncone towards the lowest part of the 1992 crater (figure 2). From\n0930 to 1000 a series of explosions ejected material to the lower\nslopes of the new cone. Sand to gravel size ash fell W of the cone,\nbut no large ejecta. Compared to the 1992 ejecta this material is\nhighly vesicular with millimeter-size vesicles; olivine, pyroxene,\nand plagioclase are present, and some plagioclase crystals are 1 cm\nlong. That evening the new cone overgrew the N rim of the 1992\ncrater and material began spilling towards Cerro La Mula. From 1900\nto 2300 a tongue of lava spilled over the N rim of the 1992 crater.\nThe front moved at <1 m/hour, but blocks constantly tumbled from\nthe front down to the base of the main cone.\nLava flows beyond the crater, 23 November. After 1400 on 23\nNovember dark gray pulses observed from 25 km away formed a plume\nthat rose faster and higher than on previous days, attaining\nseveral kilometers altitude. Observations were made from the\nseismic station after 1500. During about 1515-1525 the plume became\nless ash-rich, ejecta became less frequent, and strong degassing\npulses were heard. When regular pulses resumed, some bombs were\nejected laterally onto the flanks of the main cone. Periodic heavy\nfalls of 1-3 cm scoria were encountered by the scientists walking\nunder the plume 1.5 km from the cone. Red glow was visible at 1730\nover Cerro La Mula, and there was a smell of burning vegetation,\nsuggesting an active lava flow. The lava tongue was observed at\n1800 between Cerro La Mula and Cerro Negro (figure 2). Later named\nthe La Mula flow, it was ~20 m wide and 5 m thick, and advancing at\n~2 m/hour.\nAt 1830 a 20-m-wide lava stream moved down the N flank through a\nsmall breach at a rate of ~150 m/minute from the crater rim to the\nbase of the cone. A lava field spreading out from the base of the\ncone had reached ~1 km from the crater by 2000, advancing 10-30\nm/hour along two 300-m-wide fronts (figure 2). To the E of the flow\nthe volcano flank appeared to be bulging and was irregular with\nlarge blocks jutting out that occasionally fell downslope,\nrevealing incandescent lava. It appeared to the scientists that a\nslow-moving 20-m-thick blocky lava flow was moving to the crater\nrim and collapsing down the flank; however, the shape of the flank\nalso suggested outward bulging. The blocky lava extended at least\n200 m NE from the base of the cone.\nContinuous and voluminous pulses at 2000 created a fountain that\nsent bombs at least 600 m above the crater. Ash clouds accompanied\neach pulse and occasional flames of burning gas reached 100-200 m\nabove the crater. This activity had decreased by 2045, and by 2115\npulses of bombs appeared only every 30 seconds, although continual\nnoise suggested smaller pulses.\nOf the four GPS stations set up in the vicinity of the cone, by 23\nNovember one had been destroyed by lava and another was too\ndangerous to approach. Measurements at the remaining stations were\nwithin the error of the equipment (2 cm at best). However, two\nfresh fault scarps radial to the cone were observed on the W side\nwith 5 cm of displacement. Tremor energy increased continuously\nuntil 1200 on 23 November, after which it maintained a constant\nlevel.\nContinuing activity, 25-26 November. The eruption plume was again\nclearly visible on 25 November from Managua as a diffuse gray\ncolumn turning horizontal at ~2,000 m. At 0900 distinct pulses of\ndark gray ash rose from the crater and formed mushroom shapes\nbefore drifting W and being incorporated into the plume; ashfall\nwas reported in Leon and Corinto. At times only massive bombs were\nthrown out, while at others strong explosions sent up dense ash\nclouds. Ash and highly vesicular scoria <5 cm in size fell\ncontinuously on the W base of the cone. Pulses of ash and bombs had\na frequency of 20/minute, a characteristic periodicity in this\neruption. Pulses were strong enough to maintain a constant fountain\nof bombs as high as 600 m, some of which were large and visibly red\n5 km away; explosions were audible at this distance.\nAt 1100 on 25 November most bombs were still ejected vertically,\nbut a significant number were exiting at low angles and falling low\non the flanks. The new cone had grown to ~40 m across, and its top\nwas ~30-50 m below the 1992 crater summit. Bombs fell mostly on the\ncone and rolled down to the base. The small breach where the 23\nNovember lava flow exited was partly covered by a new blocky flow,\nwhich appeared to come straight N from the new cone, though no exit\nvent was visible. It may have been produced by accumulated, still\nliquid ejecta beginning to flow outwards, as seen on 22 November.\nThe flow had advanced half way down the flank, covering another\nblocky flow. The dome in the crater had grown to ~100 m wide and 40\nm high. Blocks were continually spalling off the dome, which also\nsustained a continuous rain of bombs from the new cone. Multiple\nsmall lava tongues originated from the dome. The crater dome was\nless pronounced on 26 November, and was blocky rather than spiny.\nThe new cone had grown ~10 m overnight.\nThe two flows moving N on the 23rd had reached ~1-1.5 km from the\nvolcano. The larger W lobe was ~400 m wide and 3-5 m thick at the\nfront with a small lobe extending down the gully below Cerro La\nMula, and another extending E into a depression in the old N lava\nfield. The E lobe had extended into forest at the E side of the old\nN lava field. Over a three-hour period the flows advanced ~12 m. A\nlow ash-covered area with a small old cinder cone separated the\nlobes. The sides of each flow were slowly (~1 m/hour) encroaching\non this and thickening. The thick lava lobes below the dome were\nadvancing, and many areas of the dome were glowing. The ~30-m-wide\nLa Mula lava flow had advanced W ~500 m down a small valley and was\nmoving at ~1 m/hour on 25 November; by 0600 on the 26th it had\nstopped. By 0645 the other lava fronts had advanced 20-50 m since\nthe previous evening. The main W lobe had spread E and a large\nblock in the middle of the flow had moved ~100 m.\nSeismic tremor levels remained high through 26 November. Tremor was\ncontinuous and distinctly felt up to 1.5 km from the cone.\nSatellite observations of the ash plume. Visible satellite imagery\non 25 November indicated a possible low-level ash cloud at 1245\n(figure 3). The height of the plume was estimated at 4,500 m\naltitude and was moving SW at ~30 km/hour. Another small low-level\nplume was seen on imagery at 0815 the next day at an estimated\n2,750 m altitude and moving WSW at ~35 km/hour. Explosive activity\nincreased on 1 December, when visible imagery at 1230 revealed a\nplume 18 km wide extending ~320 km W; it was estimated to be\nbetween 3,000 and 6,000 m altitude. By 0900 on 2 December, the\nplume extended at least 640 km W and was below 4,000 m.\nEnd of the eruption, early December. Explosive and effusive\nactivity ended on 6 December. However, a lava flow was still moving\nN on 8 December. Isopach maps of the ashfall through 2 December\n(figure 4) were constructed by Markus Kesseler based on 85 GPS\ncontrol points (precision +- 30 m). The 0.1 cm isopach encloses an\narea of ~200 km^2. An estimated 12,000 people were affected by this\neruption, about 6,000 of whom had been evacuated from 15 rural\ncommunities. Farmland was significantly damaged by ashfall and lava\nflows during the harvesting season; most of those affected were\nfarmers and their families.\nInformation Contacts: Wilfried Strauch, Virginia Tenorio, Rolf\nSchick, Helman Taleno, Leonel Urbina, Cristian Lugo, and Pedro\nPerez, Instituto Nicaraguense de Estudios Territorales, Managua,\nNicaragua (Email: wil@ineter.ni); Benjamin van Wyk de Vries, The\nOpen University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom (Email\nb.van-wyk-de-vries@open.ac.uk); Markus Kesseler, Dept. of\nMineralogy, Universite de Geneve, 13 rue des Maraichers, 1211\nGeneve 4, Switzerland (Email: kesseler@sc2a.unige.ch); Michael\nConway and Brittain E.

It finishes with some live performances and, of all things, music from a failed cartoon series \"Van-pires.\" While many of the studio songs from the first three or four albums are what Entwistle was all about, many of the later offerings are the bass player's best Who songs, but unfortunately not with The Who performing them.\nEntwistle often complained in the '70s that The Who weren't rocking hard enough in their studio work. Ironically except for a couple of songs on Smash You Head ..., and his second album Whistle Rymes, most of his solo work was much tamer musically than Pete Townshend was delivering. Compare \"Heaven and Hell\" from the anthology to The Who's version on the B-side of the \"Summertime Blues' single. Puzzling was also the absence of memorable bass lines in any studio work. You have to go to the live versions on Who songs in the anthology to find any examples of Entwistle's virtuosity as a bass player. In my opinion, he is one of the finest four-string (OK fans, also eight-string) thumpers ever to strap on a Thunderbird. Yet his solo work is dominated primarily by keyboards. Being an accomplished French Horn player, though, did promote the use of brass throughout the early albums. A great example is \"I Wonder,\" with Entwistle (and his carpenter on trombone!) blasting through kicking horn lines.\nThe anthology's first CD takes us through the four initial albums, with a couple live tracks from 1975. This where you can hear the dark humor that was Entwistle's song writing niche. His black humor comes through on songs like \"Made in Japan,\" with lines such as, \" I didn't buy the car so I decided to get married instead.\"\nThe great \" I Wonder,\" pondering childlike with \"I wonder what would happen if my fish could fly, would he leap from the tank and hit the cat in the eye?\" but finishing Entwistle style, \"Out through the window into the sky, I'm so glad sharks can't fly.\"\nEntwistle's dark wit can be found in most of his early solo works, e.g. \"Pick Me Up (Big Chicken)\" a song about being barely conscious drunk, \"Who Cares\" extolling the virtues of being a slacker, or \"Thinking It Over\" about a suicidal husband deciding if unfaithfulness is worth killing oneself over, while worrying about wasting the police's time. You need to listen closely to Entwistle's songs. And then we have \"Peg Leg Peggy,\" an appendage challenged girlfriend described \"when it comes to dancing she's the queen, she sounds just like a sewing machine.\" The Ox was never politically correct, unless there was a funny song in being so.\nThe second disc is where I have the most problems with the anthology. While I may have chosen a couple different songs from the first four albums (big error leaving \"Big Black Cadillac\" out), the bulk of the second CD are either live performances or obscure material. What was the reasoning behind including four songs from a 1975 sci-fi album called Flash Fearless Vs. the Zorg Women Parts 5 & 6? Three of the songs only contain Entwistle on bass, and the other \"To the Chop\" on which he does sing. Entwistle did not write any of that material. I would have preferred his \"Gimme That Rock 'n' Roll\" from Rigor Mortis\ninstead. The three best songs from his last real studio solo release Too Late the Hero are represented, the best being \"Talk Dirty To Me\". Following that are a couple songs from an attempted project called The Rock. This is around the time Entwistle stopped singing his songs. It became very noticeable in the eighties his distinctive nasal tone was failing him. While \"Love Doesn't Last\" isn't a bad song, it would have been much better with John performing the vocals. Henry Small, who does sing the two songs from The Rock, is a bit too much over the top for my tastes. After The Rock\nsongs, we get four live Who songs performed in 1988 by The John Entwistle Band. Here is where you get to hear some of the Ox's best bass fingering.\n\"Thunderfingers\" as some called him, shines on Townshend's \"The Real Me\". Concluding the anthology is set of songs recorded at various times over an almost twenty year period starting in 1978. They were released for an American TV cartoon series called Van-pires. While the songs are OK, they are really nothing more than a curiosity.\nThis brings us to the question, to what purpose does this anthology serve? If you want a best of, this isn't it. A good portion of these songs are just here to represent certain times in the timeline. Is it a sampler? The best songs are off of the first three albums, of which 52% of those albums are represented. You would be better off just buying those three. If you're a die hard Entwistle fan, you've already got this stuff, probably in vinyl and CD\n", "index": [[336, 350], [366, 377], [505, 514], [595, 627], [931, 938], [956, 965], [1000, 1007], [1142, 1155], [1209, 1223], [1288, 1295], [1328, 1344], [1667, 1678], [1757, 1768], [2196, 2201], [2740, 2756], [3396, 3398], [3652, 3656], [3681, 3690], [3868, 3885], [4005, 4013], [4242, 4246], [4316, 4324], [4536, 4550], [4582, 4591], [4595, 4606], [4754, 4762], [5322, 5324]], "wikipedia_ids": [77860, 77860, 77860, 2890226, 77860, 77860, 77860, 4035828, 154228, 77860, 1166368, 3636315, 46734063, 15573, 55226829, 6429, 1033826, 77860, 4036034, 5776240, 77860, 5776240, 77860, 154228, 2863226, 3434750, 6429], "wikipedia_titles": ["John Entwistle", "John Entwistle", "John Entwistle", "Smash Your Head Against the Wall", "John Entwistle", "John Entwistle", "John Entwistle", "Whistle Rymes", "Pete Townshend", "John Entwistle", "Summertime Blues", "Gibson Thunderbird", "Horn (instrument)", "Japan", "Thinking It Over", "Compact disc", "Professional wrestling strikes", "John Entwistle", "Too Late the Hero (album)", "The Rock (John Entwistle album)", "John Entwistle", "The Rock (John Entwistle album)", "John Entwistle", "Pete Townshend", "The Real Me (The Who song)", "United States", "Compact disc"]}

Firstly, the Ivorian Minister of Communication has received a study recommending opening up the market. Secondly, Africa\u2019s newest Pay TV contender GTV fired its opening shots in the battle to win a significant chunk of subscribers in francophone markets. Russell Southwood looks at what\u2019s happening.\nCote d'Ivoire liberalised the press in 1990 but up until now there have only been two \u201cFree-To-Air\u201d public television channels: La Premi\u00e8re et TV2. This is all set change with the delivery of report by French consulting company Media Consulting Group (MCG) to the Minister of Communications, Ibrahim Sy Savan\u00e9.\nThe report recommends a \u201cprudent\u201d opening up of the sector \u201cto permit the achievement of the growth of the televisual offer, and to reinforce public debate by creating new spaces for citizenship, and to create the conditions for a national industry of programme-making.\u201d\nThe report envisages liberalisation happening in stages:\u201dstep-by-step liberalisation with the first step being the creation of two private, Free-To-Air channels, whose coverage area would be restricted to (the capital) Abidjan and its immediate environs before later being extended nationally.\u201d This would mean that four TV channels would be relying on the local advertising market for financing. Cote d'Ivoire was once one of the lion economies of West Africa but the impact of the recent civil has cut back economic growth. However, if the current peace holds, then the rather tentative liberalisation suggested may turn out to be quite conservative.\nThe report lays out the requirements of a liberalised market in policy and regulatory terms, including the necessity to strengthen both regulation and self-regulation in the industry. The creation of the two new channels should be open to tender (un cahier des charges) which defined the future obligations of these new operators in terms of news and the inclusion of both Ivorian and African programmes. The report\u2019s authors were keen to emphasise the need to safeguard Ivorian national identity. But according to the report:\u201dCote d'Ivoire, as many other African countries, already has a lively global competition in terms of cable television.\u201d\nThe MCG study was financed by the European Union and is aimed at provided the Government with a tool for decision-making. It remains to be seen whether Minister Ibrahim Sy Savan\u00e9 will accept the report\u2019s recommendations. With the country\u2019s current political difficulties, all media policy choices \u2013 particularly over new media entrants \u2013 will be exceptionally political.\nMeanwhile Pay TV channel GTV announced its intention earlier this month to expand its operations into francophone Africa.The new French service promises channels and content specifically targeted to French speaking viewers. The new service includes tailor-made new packages designed for family TV viewing. Channels will include African-produced content, blockbuster international series and sitcoms, kids entertainment, religious and educational/documentaries. The service will offer an entry-level package as well as a premium package, which will include up to 10 live Barclays Premier League games per week.\nGTV will shortly be launching in the DRC, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Gabon, Senegal, Congo Brazzaville, Togo and Benin. The first of these new services started on 16 August.\nThe launch of these new services at least provides some much needed competition for the near monopoly of Vivendi-owned Canal Plus. It has kept bouquet prices high and has in a number of countries suffered severe problems with piracy. Although it does not report its African subscription numbers separately, Balancing Act estimates that its Sub-Saharan African subscribers number around 200,000.\nTweet\u00a0\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0\u00a0Send to a friend\u00a0\u00a0Share\nHome\nWeb TV\nNewsSubscribe\nNews Archives\nt\u00e9l\u00e9coms en Fr.\nBroadcast\nTelecoms English\nReportsOrder A Report\nList Of Reports\nConsultancyWho have we worked for?\nWhat have we done\nWho we are\nTraining\nAdvertising\nSearch this site:\nNews\nTelecoms English\nBroadcast\nEn fran\u00e7ais\nNews Archives\nSubscribe\nother items in this issue\ntop story\nTelevision liberalisation makes further inroads into francophone Africa\nSouth Africa: Telkom Media Takes Delivery of Pay-TV License\nBotswana: BESTV Gets Broadcast Licence - at Last\nKenya: Broadcaster Probed Over Frequencies\nNamibia: Karas Radio to Hit Airwaves\nBroadcast In Brief\ninvestment\nMorocco attracts record 17 movie productions worth US$ 111 m in Q1, 2008\nMorocco attracts record 17 movie productions worth US$ 111 m in Q1, 2008\nCameroon: Vamoulke Asked to Improve CRTV's Financial Situation\nInvestment In Brief\ncontent\nNamibia\u2019s first local soap halted by Film Commission audit\nSouth Africa: MultiChoice adds three new audio channels to DStv\nSouth Africa: First football, now Rugby goes the reality TV route\nNigeria: National Broadcasting Commission insists on a one percent obligation to run programmes for farmers\nContent In Brief\ndistribution\n3rd Lola Kenya Screen Unveils Winning Films \u2013 Swedish film wins 3rd place in children\u2019s film competition\nCameroon: Donga-Mantung Community Radio Goes International\nDistribution In Brief\nmore\nTechnology & Convergence In Brief\nregulation & policy\nGhana: Police Storm Radio Station, Assault Two Media Workers\nSouth Africa: Cabinet Approves Policy for Better TV\nRegulation & Policy In Brief\ntechnology & convergence\nRwanda: IOC Online Channel to Broadcast to Country\nSouth Africa\u2019s GetMo launches all-in-one online entertainment service\nMore like this\nNigerian online content and services begins to make inroads despite the lack of affordable, reliable broadband\nEthiopia liberalises radio and television may follow, supports thriving local film culture\nSenegal's Netcom challenges CFAO Technologies in francophone West Africa\nArab Spring prompts a new wave of Free-To-Air licence liberalisation in North Africa but still a hard core of \u201chold-outs\u201d in Sub-Saharan Africa\nSOUTH AFRICA\n", "index": [[192, 198], [265, 271], [340, 347], [441, 447], [457, 463], [627, 640], [829, 835], [879, 882], [891, 917], [1428, 1435], [1606, 1619], [1658, 1669], [2235, 2242], [2247, 2254], [2333, 2340], [2389, 2402], [2418, 2425], [2512, 2515], [2542, 2556], [3008, 3014], [3078, 3084], [3207, 3214], [3449, 3472], [3526, 3529], [3531, 3539], [3541, 3554], [3556, 3561], [3563, 3570], [3572, 3589], [3591, 3595], [3600, 3605], [3766, 3773], [3780, 3790], [3927, 3934], [4001, 4020], [6247, 6259]], "wikipedia_ids": [67393, 67393, 57744, 67393, 661989, 57744, 5843419, 19765, 21924814, 21371767, 57744, 67393, 57744, 27067, 57744, 57744, 27067, 19765, 9317, 5843419, 5843419, 27067, 11250, 76762, 5447, 57744, 12027, 27278, 19599929, 30138, 3459, 1139590, 585199, 27067, 27067, 17416221], "wikipedia_titles": ["West Africa", "West Africa", "Ivory Coast", "West Africa", "Pay television", "Ivory Coast", "France", "Melbourne Cricket Ground", "Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies", "Abidjan", "Ivory Coast", "West Africa", "Ivory Coast", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Ivory Coast", "Ivory Coast", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Melbourne Cricket Ground", "European Union", "France", "France", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Premier League", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Cameroon", "Ivory Coast", "Gabon", "Senegal", "Republic of the Congo", "Togo", "Benin", "Vivendi", "Canal+", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "South Africa"]}

He is one of the most sought after speakers in a state that already has Rick Pinto and John Calipari and next month he has a dinner engagement with the governor.That\u2019s a big step up for an 8-year-old kid who spent a good part of his youth working in the Palmetto orange groves. \u201cPicking oranges taught me what I didn\u2019t want to do and that football was my way out. I had to be the best player and to do that I had to out-work everyone,\u201d he says. Taggart has yet to coach a game since he was hired last November to turn around a Western Kentucky football program that has lost 20 straight games.But that doesn\u2019t mean the former Manatee High quarterback hasn\u2019t been competing and testing himself.\u201cI\u2019ve done more speaking engagements since I\u2019ve been here than I did in my entire life,\u201d Taggart says. \u201cAt first it was hard, and I had to work on it. I am a lot better at it now and a lot more comfortable. I learned how to present myself in the best way and realized I don\u2019t have to speak so fast or be afraid.\u201dHistory is also not lost on Taggart, who appears on the verge of becoming a rising star in the college football coaching ranks.This fall Kentucky will become the first and only state in the country to have three black head football coaches at its three major (FBS) colleges with Taggart, Charlie Strong at Louisville and Joker Phillips at Kentucky. It is the first head coaching job for all three, but at 34, Taggart made it up the ladder a lot quicker than the 47-year-old Phillips and Strong (49). \u201cWe talk. A lot of it is about where we are in our programs and life in general and not that much football. Right now Joker is not going to say a lot because we play each other,\u201d he says. It has helped that Taggart was a star quarterback for the Hilltoppers from 1995-98 and is considered the best football player WKU has ever produced.The difference is that the WKU of today is headed into its third year as a Division IA program and hasn\u2019t had any success since moving up. It doesn\u2019t bother Taggart. When he sees insurmountable odds, he remembers his days of picking oranges with his four siblings, mom and dad. They all had to chip in to pay the rent and put food on the table.\u201cI have been working hard all my life, and it has gotten me here. But we want to go further,\u201d Taggart says. \u201cThe enthusiasm and excitement I have received around the state has surprised me. I\u2019ve always wanted to be the best and tell our football team we are going to chase greatness.\u201dTaggart caught it as a player guiding Manatee to a state championship and becoming one of only four players to have his number retired at WKU after a record setting career. He spent the past three seasons at Stanford helping Jim Harbaugh turn that program around.The WKU football program couldn\u2019t be any lower, which is one reason many considered Taggart the best person for the job. Until his junior year at Manatee High, he and his parents and four other siblings lived in a three room apartment, an environment he feels prepared him to succeed.\u201cThat is where it all started for me, and every time I come to Manatee County to recruit I go back there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt motivates me and reminds me that I have not changed who I am because I am a head football coach at a university. I don\u2019t want to try and be anybody else because then I will not succeed.\u201dWith no head coaching experience, some have questioned Taggart about how he is going to turn around a program that is a doormat. Those questions do not frighten him, and this year he had the No. 1 rated recruiting class in the Sun Belt Conference.\u201cI tell them I have no evidence that I can win, but have faith in me,\u201d Taggart says. \u201cEverywhere I have been as an assistant coach and a player I have won. I tell them they have a chance to be part of something special and that I am recruiting you to come in and take somebody\u2019s job. That is the environment we are going to have around here.\u201dTaggart has recruited heavily in Manatee County, leaving the belief that he is trying to help those who grew up in an environment similar to him.

Contrast with North American histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum\nDefinition and forms of the disease\nHistoplasmosis due to Histoplasma duboisii is a mycotic infection primarily involving cutaneous, liver, lung, lymphatic, subcutaneous, and bony tissues. Skin and bone are the most frequently invaded sites [454]. The etiologic agent grows as a large yeast within giant cells. It may also present with small cells that are typical of those seen in histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum. Nodular and ulcerative cutaneous and osteolytic lesions of bone that disseminate or remain localized are the primary clinical characteristics of histoplasmosis duboisii [11, 1185, 1186, 2101].\nPrognosis and therapy\nSpecial resource: You may also want to refer to the Infectious Disease Society of America-Mycoses Study Group (IDSA-MSG) Practice Guidelines for this disease. It is available at the IDSA website.\nIsolated lesions may heal spontaneously. Surgical management is also an option. Disseminated disease has a grave prognosis, especially if the liver and spleen are involved. Amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole are the drugs of choice [6, 36, 1690, 2302].\nHistopathology\nMinimal cellular reaction to the fungi is noted with the exception of large numbers of giant cells (up to 80 \u00b5m) and macrophages. Neutrophils are usually present, especially during necrosis. The globose to ovoid, thick-walled yeasts are 7-15 \u00b5m (average 10 \u00b5m) in diameter and may form rudimentary pseudohyphae consisting of 4 or 5 cells. Large aggregates of yeast cells can be readily seen within giant cells and extracellularly following necrosis of the host tissue. Unlike Blastomyces dermatitidis, the blastoconidia are not attached to the parent cell by a broad neck.\nLaboratory\nDirect examination\nClinical specimens such as tissue are examined in 10% KOH or calcofluor. The large yeast cells should be readily visible. Care must be taken to ensure that B. dermatitidis is not confused with the etiologic agent of histoplasmosis duboisii since they both occur in Africa.\nIsolation\nInoculate the clinical material onto Inhibitory Mould Agar and/or yeast extract-phosphate agar and/or BHI agar with 10% sheep blood and/or a medium containing cycloheximide. Incubate cultures at 30\u00b0C and do not discard until 12 weeks.\nLaboratory confirmationConfirmation is necessary to ensure that the fungus is not a species of Chrysosporium or Sepedonium. This can be accomplished by the mould to yeast conversion, exoantigen technique or DNA probes. The etiologic agents of histoplasmosis capsulati and histoplasmosis duboisii are morphologically identical at 30\u00b0C and by DNA testing and exoantigen confirmation.\nYeast Phase of Histoplasma capsulatum var duboisii, GMS stain\nReferences\n6.

legitimate premiership contenders.\nSome commentators of the game are even going as far to suggest that a Dockers flag in 2006 isn't out of the realms of possibility, and while this a romantic notion it isn't necessarily in lines with reality.\nHistory suggests that a side needs to experience finals pain before they can genuinely contend for the premiership.\nThe Dockers cross-town rivals West Coast fell short at the last hurdle in 1991 against Hawthorn, but bounced back the next season to claim the first of two premierships in three years for the club.\nEven Brisbane, regarded by many as the greatest side of the modern era played five finals from 1999 to 2000 before claiming the first of three flags in 2001.\nCompare this with Fremantle who have played one final since their inception in 1995- a 44-point loss to Essendon at Subiaco in 2003, and you can see why any talk of\na Docker premiership is premature.\nOne only has to ask the likes of Port Adelaide, Sydney or St Kilda to find out how hard it is to win a premiership.\nConsider this, the Power played seven finals from 2001-03 and were arguably the best side in the competition during the season proper, having collected three straight minor premierships from 2002-04, but didn't snag their first flag until '04.\nThe Saints would have to join Port as the most unlucky side of the modern era.\nThe men from Moorabbin haven't tasted premiership success since 1966, and have lost consecutive preliminary finals to the Power and Sydney respectively.\nOne would suggest that the premiership window has closed on the Saints.\nEven last year's premiers have fallen short in recent years prior to their success of 2005.\nThe Swans lost a preliminary final to eventual premiers Brisbane in 2003, after being right in the match at three-quarter time and seemingly having the Lions on the rope.\nSydney experienced more pain in '04 when they were comprehensively beaten by the Saints to the tune of 61 points in a semi-final.\nWould you have predicted the Swans to come out the following season and capture the flag?\nProbably not, but it's clear that they were better for the experience.\nExperience is the key, something which Fremantle lacks, with only skipper Peter Bell,hard-man Josh Carr, Jarrad Schofield and former Lion Des Headland tasting premiership success\nAdding further weight to the lack of experience argument is the fact that the three players in the Fremantle squad to have played the most finals have done so with other clubs, Jarrad Schofield (17) with Port Adelaide, Peter Bell (16) with the Kangaroos and Dockers and Jeff Farmer (7) with Melbourne and Freo.\nThus any talk of a Fremantle premiership is all too premature. Let them win a final first and see where it takes them.\nRemember, finals pain before premiership gain.\n44\nVote\nsubscribe to this blog\nfollow this blog on Orble\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0start your own blog\n[\u00a0Link\u00a0]\nPosted By: TonyK - Category: No Category\nRelated Posts:\nRelate This Post\n[\u00a0Previous - Hawks tight-lipped on Everitt\u00a0]\n[\u00a0Next - Tiger re-sign key four\u00a0]\nAdd A Comment\nTo create a fully formatted comment please click here.CLICK HERE TO LOGIN | CLICK HERE TO REGISTER\nName or Orble Tag\nHome Page (optional)\nComments\n--- Size --- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n--- Color --- Aqua Black Blue Fuchsia Gray Green Lime Maroon Navy Olive Purple Red Silver Teal White Yellow\nNotify me of replies\nYes No\nYour Email Address (optional)(required for reply notification)\nSubmit\nMore Posts\nAugust 2010\n1 Posts\nMay 2010\n73 Posts\nApril 2010\n61 Posts\nOlder Posts\n3205 Posts dating from August 2006\nEmail Subscription\nReceive e-mail notifications of new posts on this blog:\n0\n[\u00a0View Blog Summary\u00a0] [\u00a0Create A New Post\u00a0] [\u00a0Add A Comment\u00a0]\nModerated by TonyK[ take over this inactive blog ]\nOrble\nOrble Homepage\nStart an Orble Blog\nPopular Orble Australian Rules Posts\nThe new season is almost here2012 TSL Fixture out soonFevola set to turn sights to punting\nPopular Orble Sport Posts\nWelcome back...Bubble teams conference by conferenceNBA Power Rankings Feb 29thNBA Weekly Awards- Feb 29thNanoFil knot trumps King SlingChanging my mind on Dwight HowardHow to make a rope lure for garFormer Tulane football coach Bob Toledo would help improve any struggling offense in the countryArsenal 5-2 SpursDoes Anyone watch All Star Games?\nOrble Australian Rules Blogs\nFooty PowerAFL ChatAFL WatchAFL InsiderSport TalkAFL CentralAFL Talk\nOrble Sport Blogs\nNBA Loud\nPopular Orble Posts\nDAVY JONES DIESWorking To Reverse-Engineer Your BrainOmega-3s May Guard Against Brain DeclineA FEW NOTABLE ORBLE STATSlove gives kids a head startDo I Pray to Jesus or to God the Father?Would you like to spend a day on Venus\n", "index": [[2087, 2104], [2233, 2240], [2491, 2498], [2517, 2527], [2574, 2582], [2690, 2698], [2861, 2870], [2947, 2955], [2959, 2966], [3010, 3016], [3076, 3089], [3091, 3097], [3101, 3109], [3178, 3183], [3407, 3413], [3433, 3437], [3495, 3504], [3604, 3609], [3614, 3620], [3699, 3705], [3803, 3808], [3855, 3863], [3951, 3956], [3970, 3976], [4051, 4057], [4129, 4134], [4539, 4548], [4617, 4633], [4644, 4657], [4659, 4669], [4684, 4693], [4698, 4705], [4710, 4721], [4731, 4740], [4745, 4749], [4770, 4779], [6704, 6709], [6716, 6719], [6724, 6730], [6764, 6769]], "wikipedia_ids": [312661, 312661, 312661, 295230, 12941233, 192093, 312661, 10257, 887867, 312661, 24602, 29210, 92922, 24602, 4286852, 24602, 617395, 24602, 29210, 4286852, 29210, 192093, 710861, 29210, 4286852, 29210, 312661, 3417193, 24602, 2939922, 22106, 312661, 3416623, 97831, 312661, 312661, 1095706, 5042765, 83427, 32745], "wikipedia_titles": ["Fremantle Football Club", "Fremantle Football Club", "Fremantle Football Club", "West Coast Eagles", "Hawthorn Football Club", "Brisbane", "Fremantle Football Club", "Essendon Football Club", "Subiaco Oval", "Fremantle Football Club", "Port Adelaide Football Club", "Sydney Swans", "St Kilda Football Club", "Port Adelaide Football Club", "St. George Illawarra Dragons", "Port Adelaide Football Club", "Moorabbin, Victoria", "Port Adelaide Football Club", "Sydney Swans", "St. George Illawarra Dragons", "Sydney Swans", "Brisbane", "Lions (United Rugby Championship)", "Sydney Swans", "St. George Illawarra Dragons", "Sydney Swans", "Fremantle Football Club", "Jarrad Schofield", "Port Adelaide Football Club", "Peter Bell (footballer, born 1976)", "North Melbourne Football Club", "Fremantle Football Club", "Jeff Farmer (footballer)", "Melbourne Football Club", "Fremantle Football Club", "Fremantle Football Club", "Jesus", "God", "Father", "Venus"]}

Colin Cameron, Dept. of Economics, Univ. of\nCalif.\n- Davis\nThis September 1999 help sheet gives information\nText files and non-text files.\nFile formats.\nMethods to input data from a range of sources\n1. Type data into an existing Worksheet\n2. Read in data from an existing worksheet or\nworkbook\n3. Copy data from an existing worksheet\n4. Read in data from an existing comma-separated\nvalues file\n5. Read in data from an existing text file\n6. Read in data from files in other formats\nSaving files\nIt can be surprisingly difficult to input data from\nsources other than\nan Excel workbook from versions of Excel the same as or earlier than\nthe\nversion you are using.\nTEXT FILES AND NON-TEXT FILES\nThere are many ways to represent data on a computer.\nThe essential\ndivide is between text files and non-text files.\nText files can\nbe directly read using a text editor such as Notepad in Microsoft Windows.\nThese files often have extension .txt but can often have other\nextensions (a common one we will use is .csv).\nExample: For the text file carsdata.txt Notepad\nyields\nNon-text files cannot be meaningfully read using a text editor such as Notepad.\nThen one obtains non-text characters that appear as, for example, @Z\nxxxxxxx\nExample: For the non-text file carsdata.xls (an Excel file)\nNotepad yields\nInstead non-text files can only be read using\nspecial software.\nIn this example an Excel file can be meaningfully read using the Excel\nprogram.\nFILE FORMATS\nThe most common data formats used to store data in\nfiles that can be\nread data into Excel are:\nExisting Excel workbook or worksheet with\nextension .xls\nThis is easily read into Excel, just like reading a Word\nfile with extension .doc using MS Word.\nExisting Excel workbook or worksheet with\nextension .xlsx\nThe extension .xlsx mean that the file is in Excel 2007\nformat.\nThis may not be recognized by earlier versions of Excel such as Excel\n97 or Excel 2003.\nComma-separated values text file with extension .csv\nThis is easily read into Excel.\nFurthermore, because this is a text file it can be read by many other\nprograms.\nText file, often with extension .txt\nor extension .asc\nThis can be read into Excel but information about the\nformatting of the data needs to be provided, as explained below.\nMETHODS TO INPUT DATA\nCommon ways to input data into Excel are:\nType in data into a new Excel worksheet.\nRead in data from an existing Excel workbook.\nCopy data from an existing Excel worksheet.\nRead in data from an existing comma-separated\nvalues text file.\nRead in data from and existing text file\n(possibly\ndownloaded\nfrom the internet)\nand convert the file to an Excel worksheet.\nRead in data from other format files if Excel\nrecognizes this\nformat.\n1. TYPE IN DATA INTO A NEW EXCEL WORKSHEET\nOpen Excel, for example from Windows Start Menu |\nPrograms.\nThis immediately puts you into a new Excel worksheet, or prompts you\nto ask for a new Excel worksheet.\nConsider entry of the following data on the number\nof cars in a\nhousehold\n(first column) and the number of persons in the household (second\ncolumn).\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n2\n4\n3\n5\nType the data into cells A1:A5 and cells B1:B5.\n(Click on cell A1\nand\nenter 1 and then enter, then 2 and enter ....)\nThen give headers to the two columns.\nPut cursor in cell A1 and right-click and select Insert and then select\nEntire Row.\nThen in the new blank cell A1 type CARS and in the new blank cell A2\ntype HH SIZE.\nNow headers (CARS and HH SIZE) are in row 1 and data\nare in rows 2\nto\n6. The final data are:\nNext give the worksheet a name.\nGo to the sheet tab at the bottom, which may be called Sheet 1,\nright-click\nand select Rename and give the worksheet a name.\nFinally save the workbook by using Office Button and\nSave As if a new workbook\nor Office Button and Save if saving an existing workbook.\nIf typing in a lot of data it is obviously best to save the workbook a\nnumber of times before typing is finished.\n2. READ IN DATA FROM AN EXISTING EXCEL WORKBOOK\nOR WORKSHEET\nThis is the easiest, if you have approriate\nversion(s) of Excel.\nOpen Excel, for example from Start Menu | Programs.\nLeft-click the Office Button, select Open and give the filename or\nbrowse for the file you\nwant to input.\nUsually the filename will have extension .xls\nor .xlsx\nExcel 2007 should read all previous versions of Excel files, though not\nvice-versa.\nFor example, read in the file carsdata.xls\n(which is an Excel 97-2003 workbook).\n3. COPY DATA FROM AN EXISTING EXCEL WORKSHEET\nSuppose we are already in an existing worksheet\nwithin an existing\nworkbook.\nRight click on the Worksheet Tab at the bottom.\nThis yields the Move or Copy dialog box\nIf copy is to the existing workbook (the default)\nthen most often\none\nchooses the (move to end) option in Before Sheet.\nIf copy is to a new workbook then choose the (new\nbook) option in\nto\nbook and type in the name of the new book.\nIn either case select the Create a Copy option.\nGive the new worksheet an appropriate name by going\nto the sheet tab\nat the bottom, right-click and select rename and give the worksheet a\nname.\n4. READ IN DATA FROM A COMMA-SEPARATED VALUES FILE\nA comma-separated values file is a text file where\neach row is a spreadsheet row and each entry, separated by a comma, is\na column entry for that row.\nThe first row provides names for the columns of the spreadsheet.\nThese files are given extension .csv.\nExcel automatically reads in files with extension .csv\nMany other programs are able to read in data a .csv\nfile, but not data in an .xls file.\nIt is a standard format for transferring data across different programs.\nFor example the file carsdata.csv\nis a text file with the following entries\nRelated text files include tab-delimited text\nand\u00a0 space-delimited formatted text.\n5. READ IN DATA FROM AN EXISTING TEXT FILE\n5a. Obtain text file with data from the internet\nSkip this step if you already have the data file carsdata.txt on\nyour computer.\nIn your web browser click on file carsdata.txt\nThe web browser displays\n1. 1.\n2. 2.\n2. 3.\n2. 4.\n3. 5.\nChoose File / Save As in your browser to save the\ndata as carsdata.txt in\ndirectory\nof your choosing, e.g. in c:/Temp\n5b. Enter the text file with data into Excel\nNow open Excel and from the Office Button choose Open\nAt the bottom of the Open dialog box choose the option Files of type |\nAll Files (*.*) and navigate to highlight file c:/Temp/carsdata.txt and\nclick Open.\nThis yields the Text Import Wizard\nThe challenge is to places the first and second\nnumbers into separate columns, rather than\ncombined into one column.\nIn text import import wizard\nChoose Delimited if the data are delimited and\nFixed width if the\ndata are fixed width.\nIn this example either option can be chosen.\nSet the Start import at row to the first row that\nhas data, skipping any preceding text such as explanation of the data.\nIn this example there is now preceding text, so Start\nimport at row 1.\nSo Step 1: choose Delimited and Start Import at Row\n1 and hit Next.\nThis yields Step 2. The default Delimiter is Tab. Change this to Space.\nThen check that the Data preview has correctly split up the data, as is\nthe case below.\nHit next.\nThis yields step 3. In this case leave the column data format as\ngeneral.\nHit Finish.\nThis should give you an Excel worksheet with 2 columns and 5 rows in\ncells A1\n\n\n", "index": [[1175, 1182], [1186, 1203], [1441, 1448], [1963, 1967], [1999, 2006], [2206, 2211], [3411, 3413], [3414, 3416], [3427, 3429], [3449, 3451], [3560, 3562], [3590, 3596], [3652, 3654], [3660, 3664], [3691, 3693], [4011, 4018], [4058, 4062], [4364, 4374], [4424, 4428], [4548, 4558], [6641, 6645], [6669, 6673], [6997, 7002], [7199, 7208], [7243, 7247], [7281, 7290], [7314, 7319], [7580, 7582]], "wikipedia_ids": [143474, 18890, 143474, 20287, 20287, 20268, 20051583, 15275, 18842163, 20051583, 20051583, 2872464, 20051583, 13673345, 928750, 11382, 11382, 2076703, 4990355, 20268, 20647050, 4990355, 2076703, 1116109, 21694, 564276, 143856, 20051583], "wikipedia_titles": ["Windows Notepad", "Microsoft Windows", "Windows Notepad", "Microsoft Word", "Microsoft Word", "Microsoft Excel", "Arrows A1", "ISO 216", "D1 road (Croatia)", "Arrows A1", "Arrows A1", "Insert key", "Arrows A1", "Car", "A2 motorway (Switzerland)", "File manager", "File manager", "Start menu", "Open (process)", "Microsoft Excel", "Temperature", "Open (process)", "Start menu", "Delimiter-separated values", "NeXT", "Delimiter", "Space (punctuation)", "Arrows A1"]}

Mike Duffey said.\nDuffey sponsored legislation this session to do just that in the Buckeye State. That legislation replaced the state Department of Development with JobsOhio, a nonprofit corporation headed by business leaders appointed by the governor.\nIt\u2019s a public-private approach to economic development that many states are taking.\nBut JobsOhio comes with a twist\u2014development director Mark Kvamme is a venture capitalist and is bringing that perspective to Ohio\u2019s efforts to grow jobs. Now, Duffey said, venture capital in Ohio is low. Kvamme will increase efforts to attract people who fund entrepreneurs.\n\u201cEntrepreneurs go where funding is and we want them to be in Ohio,\u201d Duffey said. \u201cWe want them to grow jobs here.\u201d\nIncentivizing Growth\nOhio is also looking at the way it attracts businesses. Kvamme wants to move to a model where the state is investing in companies rather than the traditional method of tax cuts and land deals, Duffey said.\nVenture capitalists don\u2019t just give money away, and Duffey would like to see JobsOhio become an equity owner in companies that locate in his state.\n\u201cThere\u2019s increasingly a movement toward buying rather than giving,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will not only keep them in Ohio, but also could provide some return on the value, long-term, for the state. You\u2019re buying something; you\u2019re investing in the state. You\u2019re not just giving away money for promises that may or may not materialize.\u201d\nMany states already have some method\u2014through the clawback provision\u2014if companies don\u2019t meet expected job growth, said Maryann Feldman, SK Heninger Distinguished Chair in Public Policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\nFeldman said incentives have become institutionalized, and many site selection firms negotiate for companies, pitting states against each other in the process.\n\u201cSometimes incentives make sense,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they\u2019ve gotten to be so commonly accepted.\u201d\nBut the recent recession may have changed that.\nLouisiana Rep. Jim Fannin, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and the state\u2019s rural caucus, said his state has offered both cash incentives and tax credits to businesses relocating to the Bayou State. He expects the cash incentives will dry up in a downed economic situation.\nFannin isn\u2019t a fan of such incentives.\n\u201cI hear it regularly from constituents: \u2018Why do we have to buy businesses?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drain on our tax dollars that I think is viewed somewhat as necessary, but yet people don\u2019t seem to want to pay for it when they have to choose between health care, highways or education \u2026 It\u2019s eating away at our tax dollars we should have for other purposes.\u201d\nThe incentivized investment isn\u2019t always a good one. Dane Stangler, director of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Mo., said during CSG's Growth and Prosperity Virtual Summit that companies that create the jobs on initial location don\u2019t always stick around.\nFeldman agrees. \u201cTypically, companies that you have to pay a lot to bring into a state are going to be the first ones that leave, the first ones to shut down and move out of town,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the state can be saddled with a big infrastructure.\u201d\nFannin said those costs add up.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question if we could actually see it all in some form \u2026 then I think it would be apparent to us all we\u2019re probably giving away much more than we\u2019re receiving through all these things,\u201d he said.\nStangler said states should look to existing businesses for job growth.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2019 start with 1,000 employees,\u201d he said. Existing businesses will be interested in different incentives than those a state is recruiting, but they have staying power. The Kauffman Foundation found in reviewing Census Bureau data that the age of a business has more to do with jobs than the size of a business.\nSome states, like Tennessee and West Virginia, are looking at ways to help existing businesses expand. Others, like Arizona and New Jersey, are looking at changing their tax codes to help new and existing businesses.\nDuffey believes Ohio is doing a lot of things right with the shift to JobsOhio, but he acknowledges this is a first step\u2014and the model is just part of it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all for naught if you don\u2019t have a fundamentally attractive state,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be attractive from a services and quality of life standpoint. But you also have to be attractive from a cost standpoint. Companies aren\u2019t going to want to go to your state if energy costs are high or if land costs are high or if your taxes are high.\u201d\nSticking To It\nWhile states are making changes in response to the Great Recession and the changing economic model in which businesses operate, they have to stick with the effort to attract jobs, Duffey said.\n\u201cThere is this complete illusion that government leaders can wave a magic wand and instantaneously overnight create jobs,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t snap your fingers and bring jobs to a state overnight.\u201d\nKarabell, the economist, said structural unemployment may be long-term because of the changing face of jobs in the US\n", "index": [[759, 774], [1595, 1599], [1605, 1616], [1623, 1629], [1688, 1701], [1995, 2006], [2067, 2071], [2101, 2107], [2133, 2137], [2278, 2282], [2285, 2291], [2353, 2357], [2409, 2415], [2546, 2552], [2611, 2617], [2817, 2821], [3170, 3172], [3226, 3254], [3256, 3267], [3571, 3580], [3611, 3641], [4334, 4366], [4370, 4381], [5266, 5285], [5305, 5318], [5423, 5432], [5437, 5450], [5521, 5528], [5533, 5543], [5622, 5628], [5638, 5642], [6190, 6205], [6319, 6325], [6646, 6648]], "wikipedia_ids": [19337279, 22199, 33336261, 33336261, 22199, 28049463, 22199, 33336261, 22199, 22199, 33336261, 22199, 28049463, 33336261, 33336261, 22199, 26840, 77940, 71821, 18130, 446212, 18718040, 17454, 18718040, 57070, 30395, 32905, 21883824, 21648, 33336261, 22199, 19337279, 33336261, 3434750], "wikipedia_titles": ["Great Recession", "Ohio", "Mike Duffey", "Mike Duffey", "Ohio", "Mark Kvamme", "Ohio", "Mike Duffey", "Ohio", "Ohio", "Mike Duffey", "Ohio", "Mark Kvamme", "Mike Duffey", "Mike Duffey", "Ohio", "Saskatchewan", "University of North Carolina", "Chapel Hill, North Carolina", "Louisiana", "United States House Committee on Appropriations", "Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation", "Kansas City, Missouri", "Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation", "United States Census Bureau", "Tennessee", "West Virginia", "Arizona", "New Jersey", "Mike Duffey", "Ohio", "Great Recession", "Mike Duffey", "United States"]}

We were too pessimistic - perhaps we were too concerned about Nady's power-free showing with the Bucs in 2006 - but ZiPS pretty much nailed it. Escroll came the closest, guessing that Nady would hit .285/.351/.476 if we wasn't platooned (which he wasn't).Speaking of platooning, much has been made of the fact that Nady hit pretty well against right-handed pitching this year, going .274/.322/.479. One problem, though, was that he hit about the same against left-handed pitching and, against lefties, was significantly worse than his career averages. That's a shame because Nady could form a heck of a platoon with Ryan Doumit if Nady went back to his lefty-killing ways and Doumit stayed healthy.In truth, Nady's splits this year probably don't mean a whole lot. He probably will go back to hitting lefties better than righties. And let's hope he does, because consistency shouldn't be high on the list of things we want from Nady. His 105 OPS+ this year is only a notch above average for a rightfielder, he's not a great defender, and he probably won't stay healthy. (The concussion and digestive problems he suffered this year probably won't bother him again, but his hamstring could continue to be an issue.)Nady's useful, but he's a role player, not a star. From a player like that, you should hope for huge platoon splits, because that's an inconsistency that's exploitable. If Nady puts up a 1.000 OPS against lefties and a .750 OPS against righties, and Doumit puts up an .865 OPS against righties like he did last year, then the Pirates have one of the best offensive right-field tandems in baseball even if Doumit is hurt half the time like usual. As it stands now, they're just a little above average.\nTweet\n12 comments\n|\n0 recs \u00a0|\nDo you like this story?\nSign in with your Yahoo!

This sounds crazy, but it's actually pretty well documented. Lefties and switch-hitters don't do so, for reasons that remain largely speculative.\nAs such, Nady's platoon splits over the next few years shouldn't be too tough to model.\nby Vlad on\nOct 17, 2007 4:34 PM EDT\nreply\nactions\nVlad,\nHave you ever seen an explanation for the platoon advantage? Does it have to do with seeing the ball better from one side or another? That seems kind of counterintuitive to me, because it seems like a RH batter would get a better view of the ball from a pitcher's right hand. Does it have to do with ball movement, pitches from RHPs generally moving away from right-handed batters and vice versa? I'm not debating that the platoon edge exist, it certainly does. But I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to explain why.\nby bucdaddy on\nOct 17, 2007 10:50 PM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nNothing analytical.\nIf you wanted to break it down, there might be a way to screen any \"picking up the ball effect\" from a \"ball movement\" effect. Actually, there are two potential ball movement effects: The one from the location of a release point on one side of the mound or the other, and the one from the direction of motion on breaking balls (since basically nobody throws a screwball nowadays).\nThe easiest way to do things might be to chart pitches for a low-level kids' league and see whether guys there still have a platoon split. If they do, it's ball movement from release point, since LL kids don't have much deception or any breaking ball. To screen for the breaking ball effect, you could maybe pull a sample of notable screwball pitchers, match them up with non-screwball equivalents who throw from the same side, and see whether there's a difference in platoon split.It's an interesting question.\nby Vlad on\nOct 18, 2007 12:01 AM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nThat seems kinda complicated\nCould take years of charting low-level kids games, and I don't have any kids. Could lead to \"Billy, whose dad is that creepy old guy sitting over there with the video camera and all the notebooks? Nobody's? Ummm ... Billy, I want you to take the cell and go sit in the car and lock the doors and call 911. NOW, Billy! ... F'in' pervert ...\"\nSo OK, who threw the screwball? Carl Hubbell, I think Mike Cuellar ...\nby bucdaddy on\nOct 18, 2007 9:44 AM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nThis might be oversimplifying\nWhat Vlad writes below may be true, at least in part, but I think there's a pretty simple explanation: \u00a0the caveman instinct of fight or flight. \u00a0Mostly flight.\nA pitch from a righty to a righty or lefty to lefty, looks to the batter like it will hit him in the head. \u00a0It's why guys get their knees buckled, or bail out. \u00a0Think Randy Johnson vs. Kruk or Larry Walker. \u00a0Yes, he did throw over their heads, but the reason it works is because almost ANY pitch he throws will appear that way at release. \u00a0Johnson is an extreme example because he was very tall and his motion wasn't anywhere near over the top. \u00a0To lefties, his pitches have to cross their body, so to speak, before reaching the plate. \u00a0Even if a batter doesn't conciously think about getting hit, it's a natural self-defense mechanism to shy from a 95mph pitch. \u00a0Even if you can't see the batter bail out or flinch, there is something inside the human body that is freezing it. \u00a0It's something that separates the good from the great, the ability to fight that natural mechancism. \u00a0If you've ever wondered why so-and-so let a fastball go right down the middle for strike three, sometimes this is the reason.\nby azibuck on\nOct 18, 2007 9:42 AM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nExcept I would think\nmost guys got to the majors by being able to overcome that (although, yes, we still see the bucket-steppers like Paulino).\nDammit, I had what I thought was a novel idea about this, and now I've forgotten what it was. I'm at the age where I have to write everything down ... I'll be back if it comes to me.\nby bucdaddy on\nOct 18, 2007 9:49 AM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nWhile I'm trying\nto remember what I forgot, it seems to me azibuck's theory would be fairly easy to gather evidence for (not for me, I don't have anything like the software needed, but maybe one of you does?). Let's say intimidation/fear was a big part of it. It should be a simple matter of splitting pitchers into two or three groups: high-strikeout, medium strikeout and low-strikeout (presumably, hard, fearsome throwers, medium throwers and soft tossers).\nThe aforementioned Randy Johnson DOES have a large platoon split in his career: vs. RHB: .221/.299/.354; vs. LHB: .195/.277/.286.That doesn't really hold up for some other high-strikeout intimidators tho.Rogers Clemens vs. RHB: .228/.284/.352; vs. LHB: .229/.304/.332.Nolan Ryan vs. RHB: .204/.301/.605; vs. LHB: .203/.314/.606.Meanwhile, a more finesse guy (Greg Maddux) puts up this: vs. RHB: .245/.277/.350; vs. LHB .254/.304/.363.It's a start. Make of it what you will.\nby bucdaddy on\nOct 18, 2007 10:44 AM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nNady/Doumit Platoon is a Good Idea\nI agree that platooning these two is good idea. We are short on outfielders that can hit so why not make one better than average one out of two less than average ones?\nIt worked in 1979 with Milner/Robinson who did not field well but combined to a make a power hitting combination. They combined for 40 HRs and 135 RBIs. Though some of Milner's time was at 1st Base replacing Willie.Also, I don't see either guy complaining too much plus they both can hit off the bench. One drawback is they both don't field real well. But the Pirates need hitters right now.\nby zogger on\nOct 17, 2007 4:40 PM EDT\nreply\nactions\nI still think...\n...that not using Doumit behind the plate is a huge waste.\nThat said, if they've given up on him there, and if they hang onto Nady this offseason, a platoon with Nady wouldn't be a bad idea.\nby Vlad on\nOct 17, 2007 5:26 PM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nYeah...\nI'd still like to see Doumit catch. Given the new front office, it might actually happen. I guess I'd just taken Paulino's continued presence behind the plate as a given, but there's no reason to do that anymore.\nYou could also platoon Paulino and Doumit. That might be even more helpful than Nady/Doumit platoon.\nby Charlie Wilmoth on\nOct 17, 2007 5:55 PM EDT\nup\nreply\nactions\nComments For This Post Are Closed\n\u2191 Top of comments\n\u2191 Top of page\n\u2191 Stories\n\u2191 Bucs Dugout\n\u2191 SB Nation\nSecondary Sidebar\nSearch\nUser Tools\nin association with\nWelcome to the SB Nation blog about Pittsburgh Pirates.\nStart posting about the Pirates\nBucs Dugout on Facebook\nFollow @BucsDugout\nFollow\nBucs Dugout on your Android Device!\nSubscribe to Bucs Dugout Stories\nFanPosts\nCommunity blog posts and discussion.\nRecommended FanPosts\nThe Pirates' Supposed Inability To Develop A\u00a0Shortstop\nby rj.reynolds 8 days ago\n137 comments\n| 12 recs\nHEADLINE: BD Exposed as Publicity Arm of the\u00a0Pirates!\nby Pagliaroni 9 days ago\n118 comments\n| 6 recs\nA Little Spending\u00a0Primer\nby Roberto 10 days ago\n25 comments\n| 3 recs\nIf Alvarez tanks, it's time to start another\u00a0firesale\nby bucfaninwa 10 days ago\n83 comments\n| 3 recs\nRecent FanPosts\nIt's Pretty Eerie How Similar Their Last Games with the Pirates were for Both Clemente and\u00a0Bonds\nby Anthony Defeo about 22 hours ago\n27 comments\nOne Aspect of Catcher\u00a0Defense\nby Roberto 1 day ago\n15 comments\n| 2 recs\nAdvice for going to Pirate City\n", "index": [[818, 827], [828, 835], [874, 885], [1141, 1145], [1176, 1180], [1263, 1267], [1394, 1398], [1654, 1658], [1695, 1706], [1710, 1714], [1755, 1761], [1787, 1791], [2007, 2011], [2292, 2296], [2464, 2468], [2542, 2548], [2618, 2625], [2697, 2703], [2865, 2870], [2894, 2902], [3017, 3024], [3026, 3030], [3065, 3071], [3104, 3108], [3114, 3119], [3560, 3564], [4872, 4874], [5644, 5656], [5666, 5678], [6098, 6111], [6124, 6136], [6271, 6278], [7859, 7872], [8108, 8118], [8199, 8210], [8764, 8772], [8935, 8942], [9054, 9060], [9162, 9166], [9198, 9202], [9310, 9316], [9536, 9542], [9581, 9585], [9586, 9592], [9839, 9848], [9860, 9878], [10247, 10254], [10726, 10737]], "wikipedia_ids": [33604945, 3524766, 2565772, 2565772, 24270, 2565772, 2565772, 2565772, 2249358, 2565772, 2249358, 2565772, 2565772, 2565772, 2565772, 2249358, 24270, 2249358, 188213, 188213, 2322110, 8219053, 2249358, 2565772, 2403778, 2565772, 170459, 615147, 674758, 386384, 394237, 386384, 386384, 65459, 182512, 581933, 24270, 2249358, 2565772, 2565772, 2249358, 2249358, 2249358, 2249358, 33604945, 24270, 24270, 34518072], "wikipedia_titles": ["SB Nation", "YouTube", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Pittsburgh Pirates", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Ryan Doumit", "Xavier Nady", "Ryan Doumit", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Ryan Doumit", "Pittsburgh Pirates", "Ryan Doumit", "Yahoo!", "Yahoo!", "Dave LaRoche", "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball", "Ryan Doumit", "Xavier Nady", "Ian Snell", "Xavier Nady", "LL Cool J", "Carl Hubbell", "Mike Cuellar", "Randy Johnson", "Larry Walker", "Randy Johnson", "Randy Johnson", "Nolan Ryan", "Greg Maddux", "First baseman", "Pittsburgh Pirates", "Ryan Doumit", "Xavier Nady", "Xavier Nady", "Ryan Doumit", "Ryan Doumit", "Ryan Doumit", "Ryan Doumit", "SB Nation", "Pittsburgh Pirates", "Pittsburgh Pirates", "Pirate City"]}

Some of you have complained that you want more \"meat\" - technical information on audio equipment. So, this month we will get a bit more technical and go through the operation of a vacuum tube amplifier, what it does, what it cannot do, and what you can do about it. The data will pertain to vacuum tube amplifiers in general, and the Dyna St-70 specifically, as we get so many requests for information on how to modify them. VACUUM TUBE AMPLIFIERS Any audio amplifier can essentially be modeled as a two stage device; a voltage amplifier (which amplifies the amplitude of the signal) followed by a current amplifier (which supplies the drive current to drive the now large amplitude signal into a low impedance load - the speaker system). Although many tube circuits will also have voltage gain in the current amplifier section, that is not important to the discussion that follows. The closed loop gain of the amplifier is determined by a voltage divider which sends a portion of the output signal back to the input of the voltage amplifier out of phase. The amplifier then does not amplify the input signal, it amplifies a signal being the difference between input and feedback signal. If the voltage amplifier and current amplifier were perfectly linear, the difference between the input and feedback signal would be only a small version of the input signal and the results would be \"perfect.\" In theory, any difference between input and output is supposed to be eliminated by feedback. The feedback signal, which is a duplicate of the output signal, when subtracted from the input signal, should create a \"difference signal\" which is \"pre-distorted\" by the amount of distortion in the circuits, but out of phase with the circuit's distortion. The \"pre-distortion\" in the \"difference\" signal, when added out of phase to the actual distortion in the circuits, cancels exactly, giving a \"perfect\" output signal. That is the way it is supposed to work. By the way, there ain't no such thing as a no feedback amplifier! There are many different feedback schemes. One can choose to use lots of local feedback in each stage and little overall loop feedback, but each device in itself (whether it is transistor or tube) has internal feedback. If one attempts to make an amplifier with \"no feedback\" except for that inherent in the devices themselves then the design becomes absolutely dependent of the characteristics of each independent device. No two tubes or transistors, even of the same type, are identical. Even if you painstakingly select and bias each individual device one at a time, its characteristics will change with variations in temperature, current, voltage, and age. It will be impossible to make any two channels the same and to keep them the same. The main characteristics of a so called \"no feedback\" amplifier are: very high cost (each unit is essentially a one off), very hot running as the devices have to be biased on very hard, unstable operation as the unit changes characteristics with age and temperature, no two samples will sound the same as they are device dependent, and lots of \"blow-ups.\" Obviously, repairs will be expensive as a repair is essentially a re-engineering of that unit with new devices and re-biasing of each device. I can live without it. The \"wonderful\" sound of a \"no feedback\" amplifier is the wonderful sound of lots of instabilities and underdamped oscillations. You may like it, I don't, it isn't music. Thus, those that choose to build stable, repeatable, and rationally priced amplifiers will use some feedback. The catch is in knowing what the feedback can and cannot do in the real world, and to use the feedback properly, so that the unit does not only measure well, but actually performs well under transient conditions in the real world. Now, back to that vacuum tube amplifier. Remember we mentioned that if the voltage amplifier and the current amplifier were perfect, everything would be just fine. Sorry folks, the internal circuits are not perfect and that is where the troubles start. Inasmuch as the feedback is supposed to compensate for any non-linearities between input and output, it is nice to know what non-linearities exist. First of all each individual active device is nonlinear. Its transfer characteristics are exponential, not linear, be it tube, FET, or transistor. Refer to the sketches below. If the device was perfect, its transfer function would be a straight line, and the slope would remain the same at all frequencies. The actual characteristics are shown in the second and third sketches. Note that the characteristics are actually exponential. The device is only very linear near the center-line of its operation, and the harder it is \"worked\", the less linear it becomes, finally becoming 100% nonlinear when its absolute limitations are reached. In addition, the slope of the transfer function becomes less at higher frequencies as the gain of the device reduces. Thus if one attempts to get the same output from any given device at higher frequency, one will drive it into gross non-linearity sooner, as its headroom is less. In a similar fashion, at very low frequencies (approaching DC) the device becomes more nonlinear and its gain drops. In addition, because the slope changes with frequency, a kind of phase distortion is introduced which is not measured in standard IHF distortion tests, which measure only single frequency performance.\nObviously, to optimize internal linearity, it is very desirable to operate each device within as narrow a bandwidth and as limited an amplitude range as possible while still covering the audio frequency range of interest. In a vacuum tube amplifier another major non-linearity is the output transformer. The output transformer's primary coil is just that-a very large coil (inductor) in series with the output tubes. Obviously the coil becomes very resistive as the frequency goes up, and in an audio amplifier this happens well within the audio range, rolling off the high frequency output. At very low frequencies the core of the transformer saturates giving very nonlinear bass performance. If one wants good high frequency performance then one must have very small output transformers so that the coil inductance is low. If one wants good low frequency performance one must have very large transformers so the core does not saturate. These requirements are mutually self exclusive. These requirements become more difficult to meet as the power rating goes up. If one attempts to \"get around\" this by designing a tube amplifier without output transformers, then one is faced with the problem that output tubes have very high output impedance and will not drive normal loudspeaker loads (8 s nominal) without severe non-linearities. Since the output transformer is a very narrow band and nonlinear device, it is obviously necessary to not feed into the transformer a signal that it cannot handle-the bandwidth of the amplifier must be limited to within the bandwidth of the output transformer. You cannot stuff 10 pounds in a 1 pound sack. The power supply is another source of distortion. The power supply can be considered to be in series with and part of the output circuit. All current that flows through the output circuit and speaker load first must flow through the power supply. The frequency limits of a power supply are real. It can be modeled as an inductor in series with a capacitor. Obviously at DC the capacitor's impedance is infinitely high, and at high frequencies the inductance is infinitely high. Thus, at very low and very high frequencies, the power supply is not capable at all. Unless great care is used in the power supply design, it may have multiple resonances, and actually be high impedance at many frequencies within the audio range. Consider also that since the power supply is part of the output circuit, if somebody offers a \"wonderful\" vacuum tube amplifier with a \"wonderful\" solid state power supply, you no longer have a vacuum tube amplifier, but a solid state amplifier, so how can it be a \"wonderful\" tube amplifier? Of course the power supply is also attached to the voltage amplifier section. Consider that all current draw by the output section causes a signal to show up on the power supply feeds. Any given device or circuit will work best when its supply is absolutely stable. Circuits are designed to reject power supply variations, but the supply rejection isn't absolute. Thus the more signal that shows up on the power supply feed to the voltage amplifier, the more distortion and instabilities there will be, as this is a signal injected into the circuit at the wrong place. Since we already know that the power supply is less effective at very high and very low frequencies, obviously the power supply related distortions will be greater at very high and very low frequencies. Again, a very good reason to bandwidth limit the amplifier to within the capability of its power supply. Understand of course that we are considering basic ground rules in general. There are many different kinds of voltage amplifier and current amplifier configurations that work fairly well, some simple, some complex. The important thing to know is that unless the circuits are executed to obey the guidelines established above the distortion will be very high under real world conditions, no matter what the linearity of each section is and no matter how high a quality of parts are used. Another common problem with vacuum tube amplifiers is the value chosen for the interstage coupling capacitors. In the case of the Dynaco St-70 for example (see attached schematic) coupling capacitors C10 and C11 are 0.1 uF. This introduces another large low frequency roll-off within the feedback loop. Since the amplifier actually amplifies the difference between input and feedback, and since the feedback is the difference between input and feedback, and since the feedback is taken off the output of the amplifier, at low frequencies the difference signal becomes very large partially due to the roll-off caused by the 0.1 uF coupling capacitors. Now remember that we have shown that any circuit becomes less linear with increasing amplitude and at the frequency extremes. The roll-off caused by the small value interstage coupler makes the front end work very hard to generate a large low frequency correction signal. This causes the front end to run in a very nonlinear mode at low frequencies. You hear it as \"muddy bass.\" The \"cure\" is quite simple, make the interstage capacitor large enough in value so that the loop roll-off is minimized, thus reducing the correction required, and letting the front end run in a more linear mode. The low frequency correction signal is easy to see on an oscilloscope. Using a low frequency square wave as a source (20 Hz is fine) look at the signal on the output side of the interstage coupler. Note that it looks much like the input signal. Now look at the signal on the input side of the coupler. You will find the circuit is generating a signal with a large bass boost! (This is true in most tube preamps too!) What is happening is that the \"flat\" input signal is rolled off by the interstage coupling capacitor. Then the rolled off signal is fed back to the input and a correction signal is generated with a large bass boost to make up for the roll-off. The boosted signal is then rolled off again by the coupling capacitor and its output looks just fine. But the \"monkey motion\" has ruined the voltage amplifier's linearity at low frequencies. Now let's look at what is wrong with the original Dyna St-70 in detail. Refer to the audio channel schematic again, keeping in mind that the \"dashed\" section is our addition, the original has the input connected to V2 directly with a piece of wire. What we have is a typical vacuum tube amplifier with unlimited bandwidth input acceptance (DC coupled) but with limited bandwidth output transformers and small interstage coupling capacitors. The power supply is also limited bandwidth, being pretty feeble at both low and high frequencies. A very low frequency signal is rolled off by the interstage coupling capacitors, turned into a \"lump\" as the output transformer core saturates, and is further distorted as the power supply runs out of steam. The feedback signal, being taken off after all the disasters occur is very different from the input signal. This generates an enormous \"difference\" signal which drives the front end into 100% distortion trying to make an impossible correction. Inasmuch as the circuits are underdamped too, the \"blob\" makes the amp ring for a few cycles attempting to digest the mess. Some people call these distortions and ringing, which extends up into the mid-range, \"concert hall sound.\" Sorry, it isn't concert hall sound, it is distortion. If you like it you have bad taste. At high frequencies the compensation in the voltage amplifier rolls off the signal, the active devices roll it off further, and the output transformers attenuate the highs further yet. This generates another huge correction signal at high frequencies, again more than the headroom of the front end, clipping the correction signal once again. Of course the high impedance of the supply has further compounded the problems. The amp is driven into hard slew limiting and all signal entering the amp while any internal device is slewing is erased. Gobs of high frequency distortion are added and part of the music is forever lost. It is very strange to think that some people use the St-70 to drive tweeters when it doesn't \"tweet\" at all-it does kind of \"squeak.\" Obviously the power supply of the St-70 must be much improved. NO! Not necessarily! Think a minute. Consider that the power bandwidth of the power supply must be greater than the bandwidth of the audio circuit. There are two ways to get this ratio in proper order. The expensive (and stupid) way is to build a huge power supply-and if the amp has DC coupled inputs you can never make it big enough. The easy and smart way is to limit the bandwidth of the circuit to within the capabilities of the existing power supply, especially if it is absolutely necessary to bandwidth limit the inputs anyway to make the input bandwidth within the capabilities of the output transformers. As mentioned earlier, the interstage coupling capacitors, C10 and C11 are too small. Note that as long as the input is DC coupled, it is not possible to make C10 and C11 big enough, as even a very large capacitor will have an inside the loop roll off when compared to DC input acceptance. To install the input bandwidth limited filter on the St-70 you will need 8 parts: (2) 10,000 resistors, (2) 470,000 resistors (5% carbon film 1/4 watt parts from Radio Shack are just fine, and it would be better if you could use a meter and \"pair\" them, so they are matched within 1%.) You will also need (2) 1000 pF capacitors (mica, polystyrene, or mylar are O.K., of about 100 volt rating - the capacitors used should be physically small) and (2) 0.02 uF capacitors (film) 100 volt rating, again physically as small as possible. Again, Radio Shack will have adequate parts and if you can match them on a precision capacitance meter it will be helpful. The capacitor values suggested are not absolute. Anything from about 0.02 to 0.033 uF is O.K. for the larger cap, and 800 to 1200 pF for the smaller capacitor. The new 6 dB per octave low pass and high pass filter is installed on the input jacks on the bottom inside of the chassis. We suggest that the mono-stereo switch wiring be eliminated as the performance is poorer when bridged mono because of the difference between the two channels (no two output tubes or output transformers are identical). If you decide to eliminate the mono-stereo switch, then do the following: 1. Remove all the wires from the input jack and mono-stereo switch except for the two wires going directly from the input jack ground lugs to the PC card (these are actually extensions of the leads of two 10 resistors mounted on the card). These remain. Also remove the two original 470,000 resistors from the jack and switch. 2. Remove the two wires running from the hot lugs of the input jack to eyelets 7 and 17 on the PC card. 3. Connect a 10,000 resistor in series with a 0.02 uF capacitor and connect the capacitor end of the series set to the left channel hot input jack and the resistor end to eyelet 7 on the PC card. 4. Connect another 10,000 resistor in series with a 0.02 uF capacitor and connect the capacitor end to the right channel hot input jack and the resistor end to eyelet 17 on the PC card. 5. Connect a 1000 pF capacitor in parallel with a 470,000 resistor and install the resistor between the left channel ground lug and eyelet 7 on the PC card. 6. Connect another 1000 pF capacitor in parallel with a 470,000 resistor and connect the resistor from the right channel ground lug on the input jack to eyelet 17 on the PC card. If you must keep the mono-stereo switch option, do the following instead of the last set of instructions: 1. Remove the two wires running from the left and right channel hot lugs on the input jacks to eyelets 7 and 17 on the PC card. 2. Connect a 10,000 resistor in series with a 0.02 uF capacitor and connect the capacitor end to the left channel hot input lug and the resistor end to eyelet 7 on the PC card. 3. Connect another 10,000 resistor in series with a 0.02 uF capacitor and connect the capacitor end to the right channel hot input lug and the resistor end to eyelet 17 on the PC card. 4. Install a 1000 pF capacitor in parallel with each of the two existing 470,000 resistors on the input jack and mono-stereo switch. For mono operation, the amp is switched to mono, only one input jack is used (either left or right, but not both). Connect a jumper wire from the left output ground to the right output ground terminal. Connect a jumper wire from the left 16 tap to the right 16 tap (for 8 speakers). Take the output from the same channel that you have the input jack connected to, using the 16 and ground terminals (for 8 speakers). To use 4 speakers connect the jumper from the left 8 output tap to the right 8 output jack and connect the load from ground to 8 on the channel used. This arrangement parallels the two channels for somewhat higher power, but lower definition performance. Now that the input bandwidth is set to a rational, finite limit, it is possible to make the interstage coupling capacitors \"big enough.\" You will need to acquire four 1 uF at 400 volt film capacitors (mylar, polypropylene, or whatever). Again Radio Shack will have adequate parts. Locate and remove the four large identical black tubular 0.1 uF at 400 volt capacitors from the PC card. They are positioned parallel with the front of the chassis, one at each corner of the PC card. Replace each with a 1.0 uF at 400 volt capacitor. The exact value of the replacements is not critical. They can be anything between 0.8 uF to 2.0 uF at 400 volts or higher. It is important that all four new capacitors be exactly the same. Further detail improvements can be made to the St-70. The bias supply capacitors in old St-70 amps should be replaced. We suggest that the two original 50 uF capacitors (C3 and C4, located on the 7 lug terminal strip under the chassis) be replaced with new 100 uF at 80 volt electrolytic capacitors (again, available at Radio Shack). Note that the positive end of each cap is connected to ground. Do not use a larger capacitor in this application or the supply will come up too slowly, over-biasing the output tubes at turn on. Although the original power supply is now adequate, further reductions in hum and noise can be made by installing an additional 100 uF at 500 volt electrolytic capacitor (a 450 volt rated cap with a 500+ volt surge rating is adequate unless you have high line voltage) from pin 8 of the power supply tube (V1-5AR4) to chassis ground at the ground lug near the quad filter. The positive end of the cap goes to the tube socket, the negative end to ground. Inasmuch as the perceived \"image\" and \"depth\" of an audio system is dependent upon both channels having exactly the same gain and phase response, and because the resistors in the St-70 (and other tube amps) may have drifted out of specification over the years, it is helpful to replace all of the resistors with new tight tolerance parts. The gain determining resistors especially should be matched to each other within 1%. The RN60D and RL42S metal film resistors shown on the attached St-70 parts list are a good choice. However using 1/2 watt carbon film resistors for the RN60s and 2 watt carbon film resistors for the RL42S types is just fine, except you will have to sort more of them to get a tight channel-to-channel match. Because selenium rectifiers (the small little finned block located in the bottom middle of the chassis) become resistive with age, you may be able to increase the voltage to your bias supply by substituting a lN4004 silicon diode for this part (Dl). Because the negative voltage to the bias supply will now be higher than stock, it probably will also be necessary to change the value of Rl (10,000 2 watt resistor) to 18,000 2 watt to allow the amp to bias adjust at 1.56 volts DC across R20 in the center of rotation of P1 and P2. The St-70 and other tube amplifiers run very hot. This tends to make solder joints deteriorate with time. Re-solder all solder connections in the amplifier, including all parts, leads, and the tube sockets on the PC card. Clean the input jacks, output terminals, the bias pots, and all the tube sockets with DeoxIT-D5 (we have 5 oz. spray cans available for $20). Usually lightly \"crimping\" the hot (inner) terminals of the input jacks will eliminate patch cable dropouts. In the St-70 the noise characteristics, gain, power, and slew rate are dependent upon having high quality tubes in the unit. We have SovtEC EL34G+ output tubes available at $80 per set of four plus $6 shipping and a SovtEC 12X4 rectifier tube available for $15 plus $6 shipping. We do not have 7199 tubes available. Refer to the attached schematic and parts list for other service and adjustment notes on the St-70. I assume you have noticed we have not spent much time on the inner details of the circuit topography of the St-70. There may, or may not be \"better\" input, phase inverter, and output circuits available. The point is that almost all tube amps are mistakenly DC coupled and whatever the internal circuits are, they are driven into gross nonlinearities. The important concept is that any tube amp in which the input is limited to within the internal capabilities of the circuit will outperform any tube amp that can be driven into internal overload, no matter how expensive or complex the circuits may be. And the final limitations of a tube amplifier are the output transformers. Lots of money spent trying to achieve a \"better\" drive circuit probably is of little value, because the output transformers still are the limits of performance. THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT DO TO YOUR VACUUM TUBE AMPLIFIER (AND WHY). DO NOT install a solid state diode bridge to replace the vacuum tube rectifier. The supply is operating at 500 volts with line surges over 1000 volts! There are no reliable diodes available to operate at this voltage. You will be in great danger of blowing the diode bridge and damaging your power transformer and filter capacitor. In addition, the solid state supply will \"turn on\" instantly, and the full B+ voltage will be fed to the tubes before the heaters have warmed up and turned the tubes on. This will tend to over voltage the quad filter capacitor and capacitors downstream, which may damage them. The output tubes will run hotter than normal and have a short service life. There are no useful redeeming advantages to a solid state diode bridge. DO NOT install solid state regulators. The \"aftermarket\" circuits we have seen use transistors with inadequate voltage ratings (operating in the \"blow-up\" mode) and have severe slew rate limitations. Remember, the bandwidth of your power supply must be greater than the audio circuits, and a series bipolar regulator is bog slow! It will change the sound, it makes it much worse! DO NOT add external power capacitors. The long hookup wires will have lots of inductance and impair the high frequency performance. DO NOT rewire the amplifier internally with \"magic wire.\" The chances are you will screw up the lead routings, add longer lead runs than the original and increase stray inductances. The probabilities of internal short circuits and bad connections increase as the wires are too large for reliable termination. DO NOT replace your capacitors with high priced and physically large \"wonder caps.\" The larger the physical size of a given value capacitor, the greater its inductance will be, and the more trash it will dump into the circuit. Magic \"wonder caps\" do change the sound, they make it worse! DO NOT use polystyrene capacitors near heat generating components. They change value with temperature, and near an output tube they may even melt. DO NOT ship your vacuum tube amplifier to us to fix if you screw it up unless you CALL US FIRST at 651 330-9871. Output tubes don't survive shipping, tube amps are heavy and expensive to ship, and their performance is limited. One of the \"joys\" of owning a vacuum tube amplifier is learning how to fix it yourself. If you don't want to do this, you shouldn't own a vacuum tube amplifier. \u00a0 2005 Note:\nWe can get much better results now with our complete $449 Ultimate 70 Rebuild\nKit.

If the output tubes are old, it may be impossible to adjust the bias pots to bring the voltage up high enough. Replace the output tubes. A shorted output tube may cause the bias reading to run away high. 7199 tubes are best selected by examining the output of the amp on a scope. A low gain or noisy 7199 will show excess output hum and/or not make full power. Fuse blowing can be caused by two problems. A hard blow soon after turn-on indicates a power supply short, either a defective 5AR4 tube or a shorted quad filter cap. A fuse that blows soft or after a few minutes of operation indicates a problem with the audio circuits - probably a bad 6CA7 tube. Note that the bias setting will vary with AC line voltage so the value isn't an absolute. It is possible to swap tubes channel to channel (except the 5AR4) one at a time to locate a defective tube. The new input filter circuit provides -3 dB poles at 16 Hz and 17 KHz which keeps the audio circuit working within the limits of the output transformers. The larger C10 and C11 effectively takes them out of circuit for AC signal purposes after the input filters have been installed. It is much more important to install the new input filter circuits than to replace all of the resistors and capacitors. Match R and C values channel to channel for a good gain match between the channels.

He was not that popular a governor and was defeated for re-election.\nDavid Emanuel\nRevolutionary war soldier and Governor of Georgia, 1801. Emanuel filled-out nine months of the term of the sitting Governor who resigned to take a Senate seat. Emanuel County, Georgia is named for him. This entry is problematic since little is known about his early life. However, sources we have consulted reference historians that state that there is strong evidence he was Jewish. However, the irony is that one of these sources is a ministers bible in which Emanuels conversion away from Judaism is noted. Therefore, Moses Alexander of Idaho holds the title of first \"professed\" Jew to be a governor of an American state.\nEd Rendell\nEdward Salomon\nMedal of Honor winner, American Civil War.

That same evening, on the NRB Network, there was a Creation Ministries International program on Dinosaurs and the Bible. 12345 Read more...

IsolationThere is a large amount of intentional and incidental isolation that happens when you are a JW.The advice that bad associations spoil useful gifts is one that is repeated continually.Now, the difficult part is that each and every Jehovah's Witness is brought up in a slightly different way. There is a certain amount of personal interpretation allowed, and there are also cultural differences between different countries.I can only speak for my own experience, and those of the people I knew personally. I grew up in a small town in Australia, and in my early years I doubt I mixed with barely any non-Jehovah\u2019s Witness children, and when I was at school the time I was not at school I primarily spent time with other Jehovah\u2019s Witness children. My Jehovah's Witness friends at the time are some of the most amazing and genuine people I have ever met. 12345 Read more...

The word \u201cevil\u201d keeps getting thrown around to describe my mother. I am always surprised by it. I don\u2019t generally think of people in terms of their actions being evil. So it never occurred to me that maybe my mother\u2019s actions, or inactions, were evil.Generally when I am faced with a question I turn to the books. I do research. So my research this week involved the nature of evil. What it evil? How would I recognize it when and if I saw it? So my first stop is to get the definition of evil. 12345 Read more...

It doesn\u2019t take much digging to uncover a large amount of lies, hypocrisy, ridiculous former beliefs, sweeping things under the carpet, arrogance, and a North Korea approach to running the religion, and playing some pretty serious hardball with anyone who doesn\u2019t play by the rules.Plus a corporate culture where you are rewarded for being obedient, loyal and not shaking up the status quo. Like a sales organization where you are selling a faulty product, initially members seem to buy into the idea, sell it passionately, but after a while you begin to see the flaws in it, and ultimately realize that you have a dud. 12345 Read more...

Their mind may be poisoned by a critical attitude towards individuals in the congregations, Christian elders or the Governing Body. Some apostates oppose the use of the divine name, Jehovah.

(AP) \u2014 Jeff Brooks had a career-high 23 points and Talor Battle added 19 to help Penn State hold off Indiana 69-60 on Monday night.\nThe Nittany Lions (8-4, 1-0 Big Ten) snapped a two-game losing streak with their second straight win at Assembly Hall \u2014 a venue where they had lost 15 straight before finally winning a game two years ago. The two teams met only once last season, in State College, Pa.\nIndiana (9-5, 0-1) has lost three straight and saw its nine-game home winning streak end. Verdell Jones had 15 points and freshman Victor Oladipo scored 14 points in his first career start.\nPenn State, the worst shooting team in the Big Ten coming into the game, started 7 of 10 from the field. The Nittany Lions used four straight 3-pointers in a 12-3 run and followed that with nine straight points to take a 25-11 lead midway through the first half. Penn State led by as much as 30-16 before Indiana finally started to rally.\nOladipo made 1 of 2 free throws, Jones hit a 3 and Jeremiah Rivers scored on a putback to get the sluggish Hoosiers within 30-22.\nIt was the first real burst of energy for Indiana \u2014 but not the last.\nAfter trailing 34-25 at halftime, and the Hoosiers charged back quickly in the second half.\nJones made a 3 to trim the lead to 35-30, and Jordan Hulls hit another 3 with 16:58 to go to make it 39-36. Rivers\u2019 layup with 12:43 left got Indiana within 45-42, and then Maurice Creek finally got started.\nCreek\u2019s leaning 2-footer made it 45-44, his 17-footer cut the deficit to one and then he drove the baseline for a layup to give Indiana a 48-47 lead with 8:46 to go. It was Indiana\u2019s first lead since 5-2.\nBrooks, who pestered Indiana all night, followed that flurry with back-to-back baskets, and the Nittany Lions never trailed again.\nIndiana did get within 53-52 with 4:04 to go when Jones made 1-of-2 free throws and had a chance to regain the lead but Jones missed a long jumper inside of three minutes.\nPenn State answered with a 9-2 run that made it 62-54 to seal the outcome.\nDavid Jackson had 15 points and eight rebounds for Penn State, while Hulls had 13 points for Indiana.\nHoosiers forward Christian Watford finished with three points \u2014 failing to reach double figures for the first time this season.\nDecatur Daily Democrat\n513fe8b5cc17799e1aad\nDecatur, IN\nCopyright 2010 Decatur Daily Democrat\nStaff Writer\nLocal Sports\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 The Decatur Daily Democrat | 141 S.

This new roadway will significantly improve the movement of people and goods through the Tampa area by reducing congestion.\nThe project, which is using $105 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, will provide a truck-only direct access route to the Port of Tampa.\nThe port generates $7.8 billion annually in economic benefits and 96,000 jobs in West and Central Florida, according to the state.\nThe truck-only route also removes truck traffic from downtown Ybor City.\nIn addition, the Crosstown Connector provides an evacuation route for area residents as well as an alternative route for commuters traveling into downtown Tampa\n", "index": [[328, 330], [356, 366], [419, 424], [487, 492], [495, 497], [523, 533], [643, 648], [789, 791], [807, 819], [821, 826], [833, 845], [884, 889], [1189, 1198], [1240, 1246], [1273, 1278], [1281, 1307], [1380, 1384], [1389, 1400], [1508, 1521], [1639, 1651], [1661, 1686], [1816, 1821], [1895, 1933], [1994, 1998], [2002, 2007], [2090, 2094], [2099, 2114], [2202, 2211], [2368, 2373]], "wikipedia_ids": [3434750, 412154, 534366, 92995, 3434750, 412154, 534366, 3434750, 5508806, 92995, 39851421, 534366, 3434750, 412154, 534366, 37081, 7515928, 737, 3434750, 86005, 2609029, 92995, 21158533, 97169, 92995, 82759, 1222585, 789156, 92995], "wikipedia_titles": ["United States", "Ray LaHood", "Barack Obama", "Tampa, Florida", "United States", "Ray LaHood", "Barack Obama", "United States", "Kathy Castor", "Tampa, Florida", "Bob Buckhorn", "Barack Obama", "United States", "Ray LaHood", "Barack Obama", "State of the Union", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "United States", "Interstate 4", "Lee Roy Selmon Expressway", "Tampa, Florida", "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009", "Port", "Tampa, Florida", "Western European Summer Time", "Central Florida", "Ybor City", "Tampa, Florida"]}

Robertson\nFinal\nScore:\n10.0\nHow\ndo we critique films? Click\nHere To See.\nAbsentia\u2019s story\nis simple enough. Callie (Katie Parker) is a recovering drug addict who visits\nher pregnant sister Tricia (Courtney Bell). It\u2019s been seven years since\nTricia\u2019s husband Daniel (Morgan Peter Brown) disappeared and Tricia is battling\nher conscience as she prepares to sign his \u201cDeath in Absentia\u201d certificate.\nMeanwhile, Callie begins to suspect that an ominous narrow tunnel located near\nTricia\u2019s house is connected to Daniel\u2019s disappearance. Strange things begin to\nhappen as the sisters deal with issues of grief, faith, and the struggle to\nmake sense out of senseless tragedy.\nCallie visits\nher sister\nTricia...\n...Seven years after Tricia's\nhusband disappeared.\nContent\nLet me start by saying that most micro-budget movies usually\nsuffer from one or more of the following maladies:\nBad\nacting\nBad\ndirection\nBad\nlighting/camerawork\nBad\nsound\nBad\nediting\nThe one area, however, where every movie, no matter how low\nthe budget, has the potential to excel is in the writing. Unfortunately, far\ntoo many filmmakers give their scripts short shrift. This is especially true in\na genre I hold near and dear to my heart, horror. You see, far too many\nfilmmakers think that horror is about shocking an audience, disturbing them,\n\u201crattling their cages\u201d. But what they \u2018re missing is that horror is about\nideas, challenging perceptions, showing us a mirror image of our world that has\na jagged crack running right through the center of it.\nAnd it\u2019s through that crack that the nightmares come...\nSo, how would I describe Absentia?\nI think the following adjectives sum it up quite nicely: confident, creepy,\nintelligent, mature, and mesmerizing. And despite a couple lighting issues (see\nthe Visual Look section below), this movie is an example to all\nmicro-filmmakers of what is possible if you have the talent and drive to tell\nan intelligent story using the resources available to you.\nI don\u2019t want to give away too much about the story, but I\nbelieve everyone (especially horror fans) owes it to themselves to check it\nout. It\u2019s enough to say that the greatness of the script isn\u2019t what\u2019s\nexplicitly stated or shown, but rather what\u2019s implied. It\u2019s the suggestion of\ncharacter relationships and dynamics, allowing the audience to fill in the\ngaps. I was reminded of the Swedish vampire film Let the Right One In, which has a similar character-driven tone to Absentia.\nMinor Spoilers Ahoy\nTake for instance Tricia\u2019s pregnancy. When we first meet her\nand learn that her husband went missing seven years ago, the question arises,\n\u201cOkay. So, who\u2019s the baby daddy?\u201d Well, through gradual reveals we come to\nlearn that Detective Ryan Mallory (Dave Levine) is the father. Of course, it\u2019s\nassumed pretty early on that he and Tricia are more than just professionally\nconnected, but Flanagan\u2019s script never spells this out. There are very few\nexpository scenes where characters prattle on and on about what has happened,\nexplaining plot points or motivations through dialogue. No, everything is shown\nthrough actions!\nThe first rule of great directing is great casting. Of\ncourse, many micro-budget filmmakers don\u2019t have access to the talent pool\ndirector Flanagan has (he lives and works in LA). But that\u2019s really just an\nexcuse. Great talent exists everywhere. You just have to be willing to put the\nwork into finding it.\nGreat acting is in the eyes. It\u2019s about an actor\ndisappearing and becoming consumed by the character. Like editing, sound, and\nother elements, acting should be seamless, never distracting, or drawing\nattention to itself. It should draw us into the story, not remind us that we\u2019re\nwatching a movie. If the character is \u201creal,\u201d living the experiences on screen,\nthen the actor has done his or her job. This describes the acting across the\nboard in Absentia.\nBut after a chance encounter\nin a tunnel near Tricia's home...\n...Something unexpected\nrocks\nthe sisters' world\n.\nLead Katie Parker is going to be a star someday. Mark my\nwords. She has that spark, a rare mix of charm, likeability, and sincerity.\nShe\u2019s beautiful, but not in an inaccessible way. Her performance was real,\ncombining toughness and fragility. People are dying for authenticity, and she\nhas it. I sincerely hope she never loses that quality. Likewise, her co-star\nCourtney Bell is a wonderfully talented actress who delivers a fresh,\nbelievable performance as Tricia. She was actually pregnant during the\nproduction, which must have made what was an emotionally demanding role all the\nmore difficult. The chemistry between the two leads gave credibility to their\nrelationship; I really believed these two were sisters who had a history\ntogether.\nOther honorable mentions are Morgan Peter Brown as Tricia\u2019s\nmissing husband, Daniel. Despite his limited screen time, his presence is felt\nthroughout the movie. His character provides the emotional core of Absentia and makes the threat of \u201cthe\nthing in the walls\u201d seem very real. Dave Levine (Detective Mallory) and Justin Gordon (Detective Lonergan) play what could have been cop clich\u00e9s, but instead,\ncreated small, real moments that give their characters depth and substance.\nAnd, of course, a real coup for the film (and one of the definite advantages to\nbeing in the City of Angels) was getting notable character actor Doug Jones for\nthe role of Walter Lambert, a man who disappeared from the neighborhood years\nearlier. Jones is probably best known for his roles as Abe Sapien in Hellboy 1 and 2 and as the terrifying\nFauno and Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth.\nHe was also in one of the best hours of horror television ever produced, playing\none of the Gentlemen in the \u201cHush\u201d episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And while Jones is amazing in these\ncreature roles, his brief, but startling appearance in Absentia proves he needs more roles sans makeup.\nI could go on and on about the actors in this movie. Even\nactors who appeared in only one or two scenes were memorable and only added to\nthe richness of the story (I\u2019m specifically thinking of James Flanagan as\nWalter\u2019s son Jamie, Scott Graham as Dr. Elliot, and Ian Gregory and Connie\nVentress as Daniel\u2019s parents).\nVisual Look\nFrom a technical perspective, Absentia is nearly flawless.\nAbsentia is\ndirected with a confident, sure hand and credit has to go to the Director of\nPhotography (Rustin Cerveny) as well as director, Flanagan. The shot selection\nwas solid. Unique angles and differing perspectives created a feeling of unease\nthroughout the film; however, these choices never felt awkward or forced. Solid\ncamera direction is essential to telling an effective visual story. A\npoorly-composed shot or violation of the 180-degree-rule can pull an audience\nright out of the story, leaving them feeling disengaged and unsatisfied with\nthe experience. Absentia, thankfully,\nnever suffers from this avoidable misstep.\nThere were, however, a few technical issues (I did say nearly flawless after all). In a few\nshots, characters were backlit in a doorway or in front of a large, living room\nwindow, their faces cast in silhouette. This wasn\u2019t horribly distracting; it\njust felt like it was more the result of limited lighting (i.e. budgetary\nrestraints) rather than specific artistic choices. An example of where\nviolating this backlighting \u201crule\u201d worked to Absentia\u2019s advantage was when Callie is jogging through that\nominous tunnel. Several shots show her at the far end of the tunnel,\nout-of-focus in the background, silhouetted against a blinding white blaze of\ndaylight. This created an ethereal, otherworldly feel and was perfect for\nevoking a sense of the disjointed and alien nature of the tunnel itself.\nAfter a\nnight of terror...\n..Callie must convince\nher sister\nabout the tunnel.\nSpeaking of the tunnel, it made for a perfect location and\nis a great example of writing your script around what you have access to. As I\nunderstand it, director Flanagan came up with the story of Absentia as a way to feature this creepy tunnel, which is located\nnear his home. Too often, and I\u2019m guilty of this myself, micro-filmmakers don\u2019t\nconsider what they have access to and can use for free. This is essential if\nyour film is going to get made.\nThe only other problem, from a technical perspective that I\nnoticed was some vignetting around the edges of the frame in a few shots. This\nwas especially evident in one scene that occurs late into the film. It involved\ntwo characters in Tricia\u2019s house being stalked by the creature (I don\u2019t want to\ngo into too many specifics for risk of spoiling the film). The scene in\nquestions was so taut with suspense, well-acted, and perfectly cut together\nthat, to be perfectly honest, I didn\u2019t even notice the vignetting until my\nsecond viewing.\nThe special effects in Absentia are understated and never distract from the story. At the end of the day, this\nis a monster movie. It reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s Mimic in regards to the central creature (although the thing is\nnever fully revealed). Of course, tonally, the movie has more in common with\nDel Toro\u2019s Cronos. Truth is, if\nyou\u2019re a gorehound, you\u2019re going to be left wanting. But I hope most who read\nthis, while maybe aficionados of splatter can appreciate a great story, well\ntold, despite the lack of the red stuff.\nUse of Audio\nThe audio levels were clear and consistent throughout Absentia. Dialogue was never muddy and\nall Foley and sound effects were so well integrated into the overall sound\ndesign as to pass unnoticed (as it should be). The musical score by Ryan David\nLeack was subtle\nand effective at setting the tone; however, it was a little overused for my\ntastes. There were several scenes where the music was meant to heighten the\ntension, but the actors are so good, I think they could have carried the scene\nwithout assistance.\nFor example, take the scene between Tricia and Detective\nMallory in the car. He\u2019s trying to convince her of his commitment and the music\nfelt heavy handed, trying too hard to drive home the emotional importance of\nthe scene. That being said, I can definitely see how the music was used to\nbridge the scene in the car with the suspenseful scene it was juxtaposed with,\nso file this criticism under \u201cpersonal preferences\u201d.\nAnd when the police\nsearch for answers...\n...Callie realizes she's\nthe\nonly one who can find them.\nUse of Budget\nThe budget for Absentia was raised through crowd funding on Kickstarter.com, a fantastic site for no-\nand low-budget filmmakers to raise the funds needed for their projects. The\noriginal budget for Absentia, as\nlisted on Kickstarter, was $15,000, but after the 30 day funding drive, the\nfilmmakers had exceeded that amount, raising over $25,000! I highly recommend\ngoing to their Kickstarter page (http://thefivedrive.blogspot.com), reading\ntheir pitch to potential donors, and watching all the promo videos they put\ntogether. The videos are hilarious (nothing is more appealing than truly\ntalented people who can make fun of themselves) and show what\u2019s possible with a\nlittle imagination and clever selling techniques.\nAs to how the money was used, I think all the movie\u2019s donors\ngot their money\u2019s worth. Using a Canon 5D Mark II, Flanagan and his DP,\nCerveny, were able to create a cinematic look using primarily available light.\nAnd while the Canon is able to capture a nice depth of field for that extra\n\u201cmovie look\u201d, this technique wasn\u2019t overused. Along with the Canon, money was\nspent on a camera package that included a 35mm Lens adapter, Steadicam,\nGlidecam, and a homemade DSLR rig.\nAdditionally, a third of the budget went to that most\nimportant of areas\u2014sound. The money was spent on both production and\npost-production sound, and it goes without saying (although I\u2019m about to) that\na film can only benefit from great sound. A movie with subpar images (see Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project), but excellent\nsound can win over an audience. However, if the reverse is true, and the movie\nhas great images but crappy sound, you\u2019ll lose your audience every time.\nBesides camera and sound, the budget also included location\npermits and another important category craft services.\nI know, I know. We seem\nto drive this point home a lot here at MicroFilmmaker, but that\u2019s because many\nof us have either worked on a set where the only available grub included stale\nbagels and questionable cream cheese, or made the near-tragic mistake of not\nfeeding those good folks who so generously gave of their free time to help us\non our projects.\nLasting Appeal\nSo, will Absentia stand the test of time? Will others want to view it again and again? While\nthose who really like their horror dripping with goo and spew will be\ndisappointed, I think anyone who appreciates subtle, creeping, quiet,\ncharacter-driven horror will be very satisfied. This movie isn\u2019t just for\nhorror fans, mind you. No, anyone who appreciates great storytelling, acting,\nand that good \u2018ol indie-filmmaking spirit will most certainly enjoy it too.\nOverall Comment\nAbsentia is a\ncreepy, subtle, old-school horror movie, and personally, I loved it. I still\ncan\u2019t get over how good all the actors were. I was completely drawn into the\nstory; not just the first time I watched it, but the second time as well. It\u2019s\na slow burn, for sure, but it was refreshing to see a filmmaker show the\nmaturity, confidence, and restraint that\u2019s on display here. I realize much of\nthe \u201crestraint\u201d was due to budgetary limitations, but all the choices felt like artistic ones.\nWhile I have yet to watch Flanagan\u2019s earlier works (at least\nat the time of this writing), Absentia makes me eager to check them out. All involved deserve high praise for their\ncontributions to such a fine example of micro-filmmaking excellence!\nFULL DISCLOSURE:\nMike Flanagan has written for MicroFilmmaker Magazine in the past. As recently\nas last issue as a matter of fact. You can read his \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d article\non the production of Absentia here.\nHowever, he only began writing for MFM after two of his films were given Best\nof Show awards. I was chosen to critique Mike\u2019s latest effort because I had no\nprevious relationship with him.

As soon as he got on, he started shooting. The others followed suit. They gathered us together on the captain's deck. In five minutes, a military ship and a helicopter arrived, but it was too late already. Nothing could be done.\"\nNo Way Out\nHeld at gunpoint, Zakaradze and his crew members -- 14 Georgians and three Turks -- were forced to turn the \"Olib G\" around and drop anchor off the Somali coast.\nThere, the sailors spent the next 16 months enduring searing heat and brutal abuse at the hands of their Somali captors, who demanded $9 million in ransom.\nZakaradze's experience, recounted to RFE/RL's Georgian Service in its \"Liberty Diaries\" program, provides a rare glimpse into what the captain himself calls the \"infernal torment\" of life on a pirate ship.\n\"They treated us very mercilessly, extremely mercilessly,\" he says. \"Kept us chained together like dogs, for eight months. We had no food, no water, and no access to the toilet for 56 hours at a time. Some days were even worse. Once they brought in bottles of urine, poured it over us, then coated us with flour. They left us like that for 24 hours.\"\nStranded At Sea\nZakaradze had nowhere to turn for help. The Greek company that owned the \"Olib G\" had gone bankrupt. Repeated calls to the owners went unanswered. And the vessel itself was about to be scrapped, so there was no chance of exchanging the ship for their release.\nThe case is strikingly similar to that of another Georgian cargo ship, the \"Vasilios N,\" which was stranded for nearly a year in the Libyan port of Misurata when its Greek and Italian owners abandoned the craft and its debts.\nAs the months went by, Zakaradze says, life on board the \"Olib G\" became increasingly desperate.\n\"The [pirates'] lawyer, or translator, would come on board the ship,\" he says. \"Since our efforts to reach the ship's owner had failed, they started asking us to call home and ask our family members to organize rallies, so that our government would [feel compelled to] pay them.\"\nBooming Business\nPiracy has become a growing threat in the Gulf of Aden, which is part of the busy Suez canal shipping route linking the Mediterranean Sea with the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.\nSomali groups account for more than half of all piracy attacks worldwide, particularly in the narrow Gulf corridor, which some 21,000 ships pass through each year.\nHostage-taking has become so profitable that many Somali pirates are eager to publicize the suffering of their captives in order to ensure ransom demands are met.\nA blurry video released to the media a full year after their capture showed the \"Olib G\" crew looking gaunt and weary. Zakaradze says now there were many occasions when he and his crew were close to death.\n\"For 16 months, all we ate was pasta and rice, boiled in salted water,\" he says. \"Our families were more or less aware of our condition, but we kept many things secret from them. For instance, I didn't reveal until I got back what they were doing to me. I was stripped from the waist up and tied to the stern of the ship, forced to stay like this for eight hours under open sky, in 100-degree heat.\"\n\"I was the eldest on the ship,\" Zakaradze adds. \"So they probably thought I was going to die and that that would speed things up [with the ransom deal].\"\nHome, But Still Healing\nIn the end, the Georgian government intervened, finally securing the release of the Georgian and Turkish \"Olib B\" sailors this month.\nSomali media reported that a $3 million ransom was paid for the men's' release, but Georgian officials deny any money changed hands.\nZakaradze himself says he's not sure what finally brought his crew's torment to an end, but credits his men with never losing hope.\nBut now, back in Batumi, Zakaradze is grappling with the consequences of his ordeal. His eyesight and hearing are failing and his face looks permanently worn.\nEven the winter snow has proven hard to take.\n\"After the heat of Somalia, Batumi's climate is hard for me,\" the captain says in a tired voice. \"I find it difficult to be in cold weather.\"\nLatest from Georgia\nHeadlinesMultimedia\nGeorgia: Can Campaign Finance Reform Put the Squeeze on NGOs?\nThe Next Stage of Russia's Resurgence: The Caucasus States\nGeorgia: Could US Free Trade Pact Promote Better Workplace Conditions in Tbilisi?\nGeorgia: Measuring Tbilisi\u2019s Security Ties to Washington\nGeorgian Captain Recounts Somali Hostage Ordeal: 'They Treated Us Mercilessly'\nAll headlines from Georgia \u00bb\nGet RSS feed \u00bb\nGeorgia: Soaking Up the Dying Tradition of Massage in the Tbilisi Baths\nGeorgia: Trying to Get a Handle on Public Works\nGeorgia: Billionaire Politician Plans Guggenheim-Style Museum for Georgia\nGeorgia: Betting on Clay and Kvevri for Entr\u00e9e into International Wine Markets\nAbkhazia: Breakaway Church Confronts Its Own Breakaway Bid\nFeedback\nWe would like to hear your opinion about the new site.

The US is barely tapping this vast resource: current wind installed capacity is 35 GW in the US and 158 GW world-wide.\nThese larger estimates are due to improved wind turbine technology, as today\u2019s taller turbines tap better winds at higher elevations (this study measured winds at 80 meters), and to more refined wind measurements.\nThe new figures ranked the following states as the ten windiest, Texas, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Oklahoma, New Mexico.\nIndiana, Ohio and Oregon moved up into the list of the top 20 windiest states.\nIn a single year, the US wind resource potential could produce 364.9 quadrillion btus, the energy equivalent of all proven oil and natural gas reserves in the US as estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). And, of course, as a renewable resource, wind will not be depleted and will continue to provide energy year after year.\n\"This new analysis confirms that America is blessed with vast wind resources that can energize our economy, create jobs, and avoid carbon for years to come--if we give ourselves the policy tools to do so, including a strong national Renewable Electricity Standard with aggressive, binding near- and long-term targets.\" AWEA CEO Denise Bode said in a release. \"The wind resource is there, vast and inexhaustible, waiting for us. Meanwhile, the economy can\u2019t wait, job creation can\u2019t wait, and America can\u2019t wait. We need Congress to act now and pass a comprehensive climate and energy bill that includes a strong national Renewable Electricity Standard\n", "index": [[508, 544], [555, 557], [634, 636], [751, 753], [808, 840], [842, 846], [892, 894], [970, 972], [1050, 1057], [1117, 1119], [1206, 1208], [1511, 1516], [1518, 1524], [1526, 1533], [1535, 1543], [1545, 1557], [1559, 1571], [1573, 1577], [1579, 1586], [1588, 1596], [1598, 1608], [1610, 1617], [1619, 1623], [1628, 1634], [1711, 1713], [1848, 1850], [1871, 1904], [1906, 1909], [2065, 2072], [2265, 2295], [2351, 2355], [2360, 2371], [2524, 2531], [2552, 2560], [2653, 2683]], "wikipedia_ids": [1711590, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 12063694, 12063694, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 29810, 16716, 19978, 21647, 26746, 21651, 26810748, 33611, 22489, 21649, 21883857, 22199, 26811621, 3434750, 3434750, 1704673, 1704673, 3434750, 50961436, 12063694, 3521715, 3434750, 31756, 50961436], "wikipedia_titles": ["National Renewable Energy Laboratory", "United States", "United States", "United States", "American Wind Energy Association", "American Wind Energy Association", "United States", "United States", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Texas", "Kansas", "Montana", "Nebraska", "South Dakota", "North Dakota", "Iowa", "Wyoming", "Oklahoma", "New Mexico", "Indiana", "Ohio", "Oregon", "United States", "United States", "Energy Information Administration", "Energy Information Administration", "United States", "Renewable portfolio standard", "American Wind Energy Association", "Denise Bode", "United States", "United States Congress", "Renewable portfolio standard"]}

I bought her a pair of imitation ones last year which wore Gianmarco Lorenzi Wedges out so now she wants the real deal. My question is: what is the difference between egg boots, emu boots, bear paw boots and sheepskin boots? These are words that came up as I started to do my research... and I'll be honest, before I spend $100 plus dollars Cheap Christian Louboutin on a pair of boots. I want to know what I'm looking at.\nUgg Gianmarco Lorenzi Ankle Boots boots... did you know that before the name was trademarked it was Aussie slang for ugly? Apparently these boots have been made for over 200 years in the land down under. Designed to be worn to be comfy and warm... more function than fashion.\nA closer look at the design though reveals more than a cozy boot. In order to be Ug, Ugh or UGGs they be made of 100% Australian Merino Sheepskin. This gives the boot their famous fit and durability, soft and snugly like a sock but be tough enough to worn outdoors.\nThe next unique quality of the Ug boot is the fleece lining. Australians are said to have worn these year round. The soft lining is said to trap in body heat like goose down in the cold weather. Yet, in the hot Australian summers you Gianmarco Lorenzi Pumps could still wear your ugly boots around because the natural fibers pull the perspiration away from your body.\nI have to say these boots do sound pretty Gianmarco Lorenzi Boots cool; no wonder they have so many fans! Still I don't know what these trademarked UGG boots are all about why are they so expensive when the old genuine ug's were 20 to 30 dollars? I think in reality it all comes down to marketing...\nThe trade named UGG boots are made by a company called Decker Outdoor Corporation. Long story short, in 1971 Australian surfer registered the name UGH-Boots and then later sold he then sold his rights to Decker OC. Decker now trades in Australia as UGG Australia and has some of the original manufacturers building boots for them. Now this next tidbit may surprise you; due to the immense popularity of the boots, many of the models are now manufactured in China! Kind of funny a product that is synonymous with Australian gets bought by an American and now Discount Louboutin Pumps gets manufactured in China.\nDecker Outdoor clearly states that although many of their products are now built in China they still use genuine Australian sheepskin so you get those great all season qualities. Now where do you buy Decker Ugg Boots? If you are in the US, a trip to your local mall will get you a pair of classic cardies, talls or shorts at a decent price. Head over to Nordstrom, Journeys, Macys or Dillards at your neighborhood Gianmarco Lorenzi Shoes mall. If you want to save gas and time the online shoe giant zappos.com can hook you up with a pair in a couple of days.\nSo what about the Ugg knockoffs that you see for less money? Chances are the ones that are less money than UGGs are made of cow's suede. Compared to the Australian sheepskin there is no comparison the sheepskin breaths and keeps your feet comfortable Gianmarco Lorenzi in hot or cold weather the cheaper product is just going to get sweaty.

This is borne out by retired UCC classics lecturer, Dr Patrick Cronin, in a newly-published study spanning 3,000 years.\nThe scholarly tome sets out the attempts made by the Greeks to predict weather change by naked-eye observation of signs from the sky, unaided by scientific meteorology.\nKnowledge of weather lore gained while growing up on a farm in Sliabh Luachra, close to the Cork/Kerry border, was fundamental in Dr Cronin\u2019s later study of how the Greeks went about it. Much of his seminal knowledge was gleaned from his father while they saved hay or worked in the bog together, or while observing the fire on the hearth with his mother.\nThis is acknowledged in the book\u2019s dedication, which reads: \u2018To the memory of my father, who taught me to read the wind.\u2019 In a foreword, TCD Emeritus Professor George Huxley describes Dr Cronin as a scholar by vocation and a countryman at heart.\nHe has combined his boyhood insights with his knowledge of the Greek language. But his rural upbringing helped him in another way \u2014 while the greater part of his research was carried out at his desk and in academic libraries, he could easily identify with the old people he interviewed in the Greek countryside.\nIt was from farmers, shepherds, and sailors that he learned a deal about Greek weather lore. His book contains a catalogue of\n720 signs derived from clouds, comets, dew, frost, mist, moon, winds and many other natural phenomena.\nThe crucial importance of the weather for agriculture is recognised in an ancient Greek proverb with a universal application \u2014 it is the seasons, not the soil, that bear crops. Most of the predictions in Ireland and Greece are based on observation of birds, animals, insects and fish, the sun and the moon.\nThe Greeks, however, use far more signs from animals and the sky than we do, though some signs are common to both countries. One is that gulls fly in from the sea before a storm, often referred to by people in Cork, Kerry, Donegal and Tipperary. Another is that streaks of light beneath the sun are a sign of bad weather \u2014 found in the folk traditions of the Blasket islands, and other areas along the west coast. Dr Cronin grew up in a place with a lyrical name that would have been familiar to the great Gaelic poets, Eoghan Ruadh \u00d3 Suilleabhain and Aogan \u00d3 Rathaille, who hailed from the area. It\u2019s called Magha an tSamhraidh (summer pasture), not far from the Paps Mountains.\nPeople in the area would look towards the Paps, and other mountains, for weather indications from the presence of cloud, clarity of the atmosphere and other observations. Low clouds on the mountains are seen as a sure sign of approaching rain.\nOther mountains mentioned by him include Clara and Muisire, in Co Cork, and Cnoc Firinne, near Ballingarry, in Co Limerick. Translated, Cnoc Firinne means hill of truth, believed to be so named because of the accurate weather indications it rendered farmers through the centuries.\nThe sudden appearance of thousands of ants on a road in Ireland has always been regarded as a portent of rain. The ancient Greeks also used this weather sign. And Dr Cronin believes that faith placed in ants as weather prophets is justified. Ants, he says, have a high sensitivity to atmospheric change and can anticipate rain sooner than man.\nAnother belief common to Ireland, Greece, and many other countries is that if swallows fly low it is a sign of rain. This sign is reliable, he remarks. Swallows are able to catch insects at high levels in fine weather, but when the atmosphere is very humid, just prior to rain, insects remain near ground level so that swallows descend in pursuit.\nNot all the old signs could be trusted, but people all over the world have benefited over millennia from the wisdom of weather lore.\n* Greek Popular Meteorology from Antiquity to the Present\n", "index": [[630, 635], [940, 945], [1016, 1022], [1069, 1080], [1406, 1409], [1550, 1556], [1729, 1743], [1758, 1762], [1763, 1768], [1831, 1837], [2159, 2162], [2331, 2336], [2561, 2566], [2653, 2658], [2891, 2896], [3013, 3020], [3025, 3031], [3120, 3126], [3326, 3330], [3332, 3337], [3339, 3346], [3351, 3360], [3518, 3528], [3622, 3628], [3838, 3842], [4103, 4110], [4135, 4146], [4151, 4162], [4164, 4174], [4377, 4384], [4444, 4450], [4690, 4697], [4699, 4705], [5179, 5188], [5196, 5203]], "wikipedia_ids": [14560, 14560, 12108, 20076, 738094, 12108, 993435, 46709, 92615, 12108, 142298, 12108, 12108, 12108, 12108, 14560, 12108, 12108, 46709, 92615, 2818885, 2802637, 174579, 28397, 4489, 46709, 4548727, 97827, 18630637, 14560, 12108, 14560, 12108, 252905, 873021], "wikipedia_titles": ["Republic of Ireland", "Republic of Ireland", "Greece", "Martin Luther King Jr.", "University College Cork", "Greece", "Sliabh Luachra", "County Cork", "County Kerry", "Greece", "Trinity College Dublin", "Greece", "Greece", "Greece", "Greece", "Republic of Ireland", "Greece", "Greece", "County Cork", "County Kerry", "Donegal GAA", "Tipperary GAA", "West Coast of the United States", "Scottish Gaelic", "Breast", "County Cork", "Ballingarry, County Limerick", "County Limerick", "Translation", "Republic of Ireland", "Greece", "Republic of Ireland", "Greece", "Classical antiquity", "Present"]}

Use the Unlocker and if the item is bad, then reset the game.\nElement stylesThe Element of the type of chips you use depends on what style you get first. For example, Fire Chips for Fire Element, Water Chips for Water Element, etc.\nShadow Wide SwordIf you have any type of Shadow Chip and already upgraded the charge in your Mega Man profile, equip the Shadow Chip during battle and charge your Blaster while you are in shadow mode. When the charge is ready, release A and you will immediately transport to the enemy panels. The closest enemy to you will be hit with the Shadow Wide Sword, as well as anyone else in a vertical angle. The damage is the same from your Blaster when charged.\nBattle BassAfter defeating Planetman, you can fight the real Bass. He has 2000 HP and a Life Aura 1 that will reappear. When you defeat him, you will get his Bass chip.\nTransparent Mega ManGo to a panel in Kotobuki, Yumland, or Undernet and slide on the arrow panels. Walk back into the panels. Note: It should not t let you through. This will make two Mega Man bodies appear; if not, just two faces.\nThird folderDefeat Shadowman and Freezeman. Then, go to the Mother Computer area. Go to the second mini-computer (the first one you jack into). There will be a girl there that wants a Bigbomb Star. Give one to her and she will give you a Program Advance Folder. Note: It does not contain every Chip for every Program Advance.\nRemoving panelsWhen you get into a battle and there are panels that move you up and down, wait until the chip selector appears. If Repair is in your deck, use it and it will take away the panels that move you up and down.\nBlocking FishysWhenever you fight a Fishy (V1 V2 or V3), use a chip that sets up an obstacle (Remobit, Guardian, etc.) and put it in front of you. The Fishys cannot go through these obstacles. This is useful for buying time to get chips or PA in the exams.\nUsing SlasherHold A and if an enemy comes in front of you, they will get hit.\nGet Sanctuary chip (266)Get all of the five stars and begin hard mode. When you complete hard mode, Sanctuary will be in your original save file (not hard mode).\nBodyGaurd Advance Put the following chips in the order shown: Dropdown S, Anti-Navi S, ShadowMan S (V1,V2,V3).\nCurse Advance The Curse Advance does quite a lot of damage. You must have CurseShield1, 2, and 3; Code: P, A, or O for all of them. To use any of the CurseShields, you must get hit, then the thing dashes out and bites. The Curse Advance dashes down all three lines, biting.\nBigHeart Advance Select, in order, HolyPanel R (from Brush Man), Recover300 R (from having SS or SSS license in Undernet 7), and Roll R (v1,v2,v3).\nPoisPhar AdvancePut the following chips in the order shown: PoisMask A,Poisface A, Anubis A.\nSubchip plus memoryAfter you defeat Magnet Man, go to Netopia. In first screen (after going out from Arrival Lobby), search a tree in west screen. Talk to the boy and you will get Subchip plus memory.\nZeta Cannon upgrade chipDuring a fight, at any time you get these chips, you will form the Zeta Cannon: Cannon A, Cannon B, Cannon C. Note: You have only five seconds with this cannon -- shoot as many shots as possible. Remember to put them in alphabetical order.\nZ-Canon2 ChipSelect Hi-Cannons C D E, DEF, or E F G in that order. This allows you to shoot Hi-Cannons with unlimited ammunition for five seconds at the speed of the X-Buster. This can only be selected in battle.\nZ-Canon1 ChipSelect Cannons ABC, B C D, or C D E in that order. This allows you to shoot Cannons with unlimited ammunition for five seconds at the speed of the X-Buster. This can only be selected in battle.\n2xHero Chip Advance You must have these chips in this order during a battle for the 2xHero Chip upgrade: Custswrd B, Varswrd B, Protoman B. Note: You must have the same code and have to be in the order shown.\nO-Canon1 ChipSelect Cannons A B C D and E in that order. This allows you to shoot Cannons with unlimited ammunition for ten seconds at the speed of the X-Buster. This can only be selected in battle.\nSecret chips (251 to 260)To get the ten secret chips, you must have two Gameboy Advances, two Mega Man Battle Network 2 games, and a link cable. Both games must have at least three stars next to their name. If you have four stars, the odds will be higher. Link up the games and go into Network. Save the game when prompted, then choose Netbattle (not Practice Battle). Battle the other person and get an S rank on them. This is done easier if one player allows the other to kill them. You will get a secret chip approximately every twenty battles. The secret chip you get will be random.\nDarkness Advance In order to get the strongest attack in the game, you must have these chips in this order: Bass v3 X, AntiNavi X, Fire/Aqua/Elec/Wood Gspl X. Note: It will not work with another Bass because their chip code is F.\nO-Canon2 ChipSelect Hi-Cannons C D E F and G in that order. This allows you shoot Hi-Cannons with unlimited ammunition for ten seconds at the speed of the X-Buster. This can only be selected in battle.\nBest Chip Trader The best Chip Trader is the one in the ACDC Town Metroline.\nGeddon3 chip After you defeat Shadow Man, go to MarinHarbor. From the center building, go down the flight of stairs and look closely at the screen. You should see a blur every few seconds. Walk up and talk to it. A little girl will say, \"You found it! You take it\". You will receive the Geddon3 chip.\nAfter acquiring the Geddon3 chip, put it in your folder with a Repair Chip (preferably a * code chip). Being that it makes all panels, swap panels (which constantly takes your health away). Use the Repair to fix your panels, leaving your opponents to suffer. Note: Have Repair out when you take out Geddon 3.\nAirman Version 3 You can find Airman Version 3 in Den Area 1. He deals around 100 damage for each attack but you can get 500 Zenny if you have a low rankFor about a Busting Lv. 6, you can get another Airman Chip.\nNavi Chip codes The code at the bottom of a Navi chip is its name in Japanese. For example, Bass is named Forte and his code is F. Protoman is named Blues and his symbol is B.\nSSS license Set either an Invis chip with a * code as your default chip, and make sure you have the chip ZeusHamr. In most of the battles, this will kill all the enemies. It can break through Guard; it even works on Hardheads. Note: Make sure that if there is a Cloudy or a Flappy that you do not use ZeusHamr until after they land or else it will not hit them.\nGetting free Navi chips You can get Navi chips in the slot in Netopia near the Hotel and Bank. Choose ten chips in the slot and get a new Navi chip back free. Sometimes you can even get Version 2 Chips. Note: A Navi chip does not appear every time.\nDefeat Freezeman, then go to ACDCtown. There will be a chip trader by the posters. You will get all the Navi chips except Bass and a few other that you can get only in the WWW area.\nBlack Navi locations Black Navi 1: Underkoto Black Navi 2: Undernet area 6 Black Navi 3: Netarea 2 Black Navi 4: Yumland area 2\nEasy S-busting level A very good way to get an S busting level is to use Advances. It seems necessary for some Bosses such as Bass. Some good ones are: Life Srd 3 (line up Elec, Heat, and aqua Blades. Buy them or get them from Green Mystery Data in WWW area 1); Arrows (Double, Triple, and Quad Needle); and Ultra bomb (Lil, Cros, and Big Bombs).\nSS licenseAfter you get the S license, \"Delete Gospel\", and \"Star ID\", go through the Undernet to where the laser grid with the \"?\" on it was located. Check it and it will open. The portal will then take you directly to the WWW area 1. Go through with your S license in hand, but be careful. Once you are inside the WWW you cannot jack out. Once through, you will see many new enemies and some are very difficult to kill. Just run from or kill them and use Full-Enrgs. Go as far as you can through WWW in area 1. Do not go into area 2, no matter what. You will find a cube requiring an S license to open. There are still more obstacles, Before going through the portal there, you will encounter three Protecto1s. To delete these you will have to do 200 damage to all of them at once. Once they are gone, go through the portal and unlock the \"Mystery Data\". It is army data. Jack out at this point and save the game. Jack back in again and go to the License Examiner. You can now take the test.\nExtra Damage from Airman Chip Go to the front and if an enemy is in the front rank also, use the Airman chip to do double the damage.\nGamecube logoAfter defeating Shadowman, reenter the main mother computer. Go to the back of the computer. Stand in front of the \"mother computer main server\", where Shadowman was standing before you fought him. Slowly go to Megaman's right. Upon a stack of cubes with purple, squiggly lines on them will be the Gamecube logo.\nEasy Zenny From where you are presently, keep walking around and battle a lot of enemies. If you are in Ms. Million's bag, you can get about 400 Zenny in each battle. You can also get 10,000 Zenny from doing the love letter job and from Ms. Millions.\nIn the Undernet 5 are three Green Mystery Datas. Save in front of them, then move the pointer in one direction to receive 100 Zenny, a virus, or 50,000 Zenny in each one of the three Green Mystery Datas.\nMake sure you have Untrap. Go to Undernet 5. There will be three mystery program data. Use the Sub-chip Untrap and walk up to one of the mystery data. Unlock it. It will more than likely say \"You got 100 Zenny!\". Find the other one. It will usually have the same message. Find the last one. It will say \"You got 50,000 Zenny!\". Then, jack out and do it again. You can only do this a total of seven times; save it for when you need it.\nStrongest ComboAt the Battle with etheir the Opponent are Virus or Navi, put a Battle Chip \"Prism\" right in middle of the Opponent`s Field. Then throw a \"Forest Bomb\" to the Prism on the opponent`s field.\nWWW areaSuccessfully complete the game to unlock the WWW area. Go to Ula Internet area 4 and look for a glowing red warp. Enter it to access the WWW\n", "index": [[833, 841], [1258, 1262], [1276, 1278], [1355, 1359], [1550, 1558], [2055, 2061], [2198, 2200], [2249, 2257], [2386, 2388], [2749, 2751], [2852, 2856], [3119, 3121], [3772, 3775], [3975, 3978], [4656, 4681], [4848, 4855], [5345, 5349], [5423, 5424], [5689, 5699], [6476, 6480], [6551, 6559], [6574, 6578], [6631, 6636], [6920, 6926], [7206, 7213], [7391, 7395], [7441, 7444], [7705, 7709], [7751, 7755], [7757, 7761], [7828, 7831], [7841, 7847], [7849, 7855], [7857, 7863], [7904, 7908], [8150, 8153], [8242, 8245], [8424, 8427], [9083, 9092], [9219, 9228], [9278, 9285], [9365, 9373], [10292, 10298], [10328, 10333], [10403, 10408], [10528, 10531], [10620, 10623]], "wikipedia_ids": [170424, 3916, 21347024, 3916, 170424, 1392564, 32528, 19344515, 23332, 32528, 5225, 173555, 29680, 62027, 2173736, 4122592, 3916, 495652, 5603122, 19553, 15573, 3916, 3352, 47515, 920901, 3916, 33139, 3916, 9531, 19593167, 33139, 800001, 300740, 300742, 23533163, 33139, 33139, 33139, 588440, 588440, 170424, 53525, 4181, 19167679, 10603, 33139, 33139], "wikipedia_titles": ["Mega Man", "Bass guitar", "Hewlett-Packard", "Bass guitar", "Mega Man", "Home repair", "Visual cortex", "The Guardian", "Pennsylvania", "Visual cortex", "Code", "Shortstop", "Tambourine", "American Broadcasting Company", "Mega Man Battle Network 2", "Computer network", "Bass guitar", "Goal (ice hockey)", "Shadow Man (1988 film)", "Microprocessor", "Japan", "Bass guitar", "Blues", "Cloud", "Software versioning", "Bass guitar", "World Wide Web", "Bass guitar", "Electrical engineering", "Heat", "World Wide Web", "Arrows Grand Prix International", "Double (baseball)", "Triple (baseball)", "ChromeOS", "World Wide Web", "World Wide Web", "World Wide Web", "Shadowman (comics)", "Shadowman (comics)", "Mega Man", "GameCube", "Battle", "Virus", "Field (mathematics)", "World Wide Web", "World Wide Web"]}

Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Children Hospital of\nRiga, Sweden and Latvia.\nJuvenile Rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a heterogeneous\ndisease consisting of several clinical subgroups. It is an autoimmune disease\nassociated with the HLA class II genes. It is negatively associated with\nHLA-DR1-DQ5 in Latvians. DR1-DQ5 was also decreased in seronegative patients\ncompared to seropositive patients in Latvian JRA. In addition to HLA, we\nlooked for an additional second susceptibility loci for JRA in Major Histocompatibility\nClass III region. MICA gene is located in the MHC class III region and\nis expressed by monocytes, keratinocytes and endothelial cells. Sequence\ndetermination of MICA gene identifies trinucleotide repeat (GCT) microsatellite\npolymorphism, which identifies 5 alleles with 4,5,6 and 9 repetitions of\nGCT or 5 repetitions of GCT with 1 additional nucleotide insertion (GGCT).\nThe alleles are A4, A5, A5.1 , A6 and A9. The aim of our study was to find\nthe association of MICA alleles with JRA patients (n=119) and healthy controls\n(n=108) from Latvia. The samples were analysed for MICA by PCR amplification\nand fragment sizes were determined in ABI prism DNA sequencer. HLA-DQ was\ngenotyped by PCR-SSO.\nAllele 4 was significantly increased in patients\n(40/119, 34%) compared to controls (19/108, 17%)(OR=2.37, p<0.01, Pc<0.05).\n4/5.1 genotype was also significantly increased in JRA patients (22/119,\n18%) compared to 7/108 (6%) controls (OR=3.27, p<0.01, Pc<0.05).\n5/5.1 genotype was decreased in JRA patients (4/119, 3%) compared to 13/108\n(12%) controls (OR=0.25, p<0.01, Pc=ns).\nIn conclusion, allele A4 of MICA is increased in\nJRA patients compared to healthy controls and 4/5.1 genotype also increased\nin Latvian patients with JRA. Our findings suggest that MICA may play an\nimportant role in the etiopathogenesis of IDDM\n", "index": [[131, 134], [186, 193], [208, 237], [291, 296], [298, 318], [320, 329], [331, 348], [352, 356], [358, 364], [369, 375], [408, 411], [598, 606], [697, 704], [705, 708], [725, 728], [789, 792], [839, 843], [982, 986], [1209, 1211], [1213, 1215], [1224, 1226], [1231, 1233], [1287, 1291], [1305, 1308], [1360, 1366], [1398, 1402], [1406, 1409], [1462, 1465], [1487, 1493], [1635, 1637], [1696, 1699], [1773, 1775], [1815, 1818], [1928, 1932], [1949, 1952], [2028, 2035], [2050, 2053], [2081, 2085], [2140, 2144]], "wikipedia_ids": [211950, 17514, 619071, 22173009, 216908, 26741, 968332, 25508, 5058739, 17514, 101964, 17514, 17514, 101964, 302013, 101964, 21061, 21061, 25970620, 30518649, 34970416, 13279640, 21061, 101964, 17514, 21061, 23647, 12964868, 7194104, 18457137, 101964, 18457137, 101964, 21061, 101964, 17514, 101964, 21061, 2812725], "wikipedia_titles": ["Major histocompatibility complex", "Latvia", "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis", "Rumba Parish", "Karolinska Institute", "Stockholm", "Children's hospital", "Riga", "Sweden", "Latvia", "Japanese Red Army", "Latvia", "Latvia", "Japanese Red Army", "Human leukocyte antigen", "Japanese Red Army", "Mica", "Mica", "Apple A4", "Apple A5", "Apple A6", "HLA-A9", "Mica", "Japanese Red Army", "Latvia", "Mica", "Polymerase chain reaction", "Applied Biosystems", "HLA-DQ", "Personal computer", "Japanese Red Army", "Personal computer", "Japanese Red Army", "Mica", "Japanese Red Army", "Latvia", "Japanese Red Army", "Mica", "Type 1 diabetes"]}

It peaked in 2008, shortly before the stock market crash, and it rebounded in 2009.Sounds great. But in fact, if you look at it, copper actually rises and falls with general market sentiment. It's more of a barometer than forecaster.A far better forecaster would be a metal that moves before the event, a metal that peaks or troughs early \u2013 in late 2006, early 2007, say, or in 2010.Such a metal exists. It's copper's less widely discussed, less glamorous industrial cousin: zinc.So what can it tell us about today's market? And what's the best way to play it?Zinc isn't glamorous or world-savingUnlike uranium, rare earth metals, or even gold and silver, zinc is not a metal that is going to save the world. It's not the answer to looming energy, technical or monetary problems.Its main use (over 50%) is in galvanising, to prevent rust. Zinc is very reactive, so a quick coat of zinc on your iron or steel will attract all the oxidisation and protect the metal beneath. It's also used extensively in alloys (brass and bronze in particular) and compounds. You'll find zinc in a huge range of applications, from communication equipment to coins to cars to piping to bearings to water valves.It's widely used (only iron ore, copper and aluminium are more heavily used). But there's no huge deficit between global zinc supply and demand to get excited about \u2013 there's lots of it and when demand grows, production can be increased too.Identified worldwide resources are estimated at just below the two billion tonne mark. The largest deposits are in Canada, the US, Australia and Iran. Annual global production stands at around 12 million tonnes, 70% of which comes from mining and 30% from recycling.According to recent data made available to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG), world demand exceeded supply by 223,000 tonnes in 2011, in the year to date. World stock levels increased by 201,000 tonnes, although London Metal Exchange stockpiles (along with those of all base metals, interestingly) have been declining since the summer.From the same data, we see world zinc production rose by 14.5%; apparent Chinese demand increased by 14.9% and world usage by 16.7%.A history of the zinc priceAs for the zinc price, it is trading in a fairly tight range. Its year high was just above $1.1/lb in February and its low, in October, was $0.80/lb.Here we see a long-term chart of zinc since 1989.\u00a0It fell from about $0.90/lb in the late '80s to $0.40/lb in 1993, then spent the rest of the decade mired in a tight range between $0.40 and $0.55 or so, with one brief spike above that level.After the dotcom crash, it sunk even below $0.40/lb until 2003 when it began to creep up \u2013 in line with general market sentiment.But then in 2004-5 it broke out above that multi-year $0.50/lb or so cap and within two years quadrupled. In late 2006 it broke above $2/lb. Insane stuff. If ever there is a chart that reflects the bubble of credit and speculative excess the world got itself into in that period, it's this one.Then the zinc price began falling \u2013 ahead of the markets \u2013 and quickly returned to $0.50/lb break-out point, giving back all of the gains of the previous two or three years.We then got the proverbial 'dead cat bounce', which petered out at $1.20 in 2010. We have been stuck in a range ever since, between there and $0.80 on the downside. This month it has turned back up.Professor Zinc's psychic powersI would say Professor Zinc better reflects the real global state of things than the Dr Copper. In July 2008 copper was making new highs (with oil), when zinc had long-since turned down, and the credit crunch was in full flight.In early 2011, copper made new highs again, above 2006 and 2007 levels \u2013 when the real economy was in a more parlous state. Here's a chart of copper over that period. To me, it is less a reflection of the economy and more a reflection of the speculative excess at the extreme end of finance.So what is zinc telling us now?It has turned up, and I see some buying coming back into the junior mining end of markets, so perhaps we can expect this rally to continue until Christmas and even into the New Year.But there are plenty of problems lurking on the sidelines, as we all know, so I would be ready to jump ship should they rear their ugly heads again. And I'll be watching closely to see if the zinc price provides an early warning of the next downturn.If you wanted to trade zinc, ETF Securities offers a zinc ETF (LSE: ZINC). But I can't see the point. I don't see huge price rises in zinc itself coming. The top large-cap zinc-producing companies include Xstrata, OZ Minerals, Teck Cominco and Glencore, all of which may be ripe for a rally to early next year.However, the small-caps offer more growth potential. One suggestion for a small-cap, pure play on zinc is the former golden boy ZincOx resources (Aim: ZOX), a company whose management I like.I should also mention Toronto Venture Exchange-listed Vena Resources (TSX: VEM), a company I have mentioned here before. It is bringing a zinc mine into production in Peru and, according to reports, it has made good progress. Vena has been hammered this year for two reasons.First, there was a lot of (probably misplaced) risk perceived about the new Peruvian government being mining unfriendly. Second, Vena is also exploring large uranium deposits and the market fell horribly out of love with uranium after Fukushima. But below C$0.20c Vena offers potential value and growth (I hold the stock myself).My latest gold report is now available \u2013 as well as looking at ways to buy gold itself, I\u2019ve also tipped some speculative mining stocks that I think are poised to do very well in the coming years, and provided some updates on my previous tips.

Don't get stuck, get a grip. If you bury your head in the sand, then circumstances will force you to make long overdue changes. Better by far to stay ahead of the game, and volunteer for the inevitable. That way you have a better chance of staying in control of events and directing your future path.\nSolar eclipses happen every six months, in different cycles which recur every 18.5 years (the Saros Cycle). The sign and cycle in which the eclipse occurs will tell you which area of your activities is shouting for a shakeup.\nIn the rundown below read your Sun sign and your Ascendant sign. [If you don't know your ascendant, go to www.star4cast.com FREE Birth Charts and it will calculate it for you.]\nTake time to work out what happened to you personally 18.5 years ago, or 37. The two major domestic/country moves in my life took place exactly that distance apart in the years of eclipses in the same cycle. And I only worked that one out after the decision was taken.\nThis approaching December solar eclipse in Sagittarius will obviously have more effect on Sagittarian Sun or Ascendant types, who are at a real turning point in their lives. Geminis are looking closely at relationships. The other mutable signs, Virgo and Pisces are focusing on home and work matters. Taurus and Scorpio are money-minded; Capricorn and Cancer have work and health dilemmas; Leo and Aquarius are trying to balance love and friendships; Aries and Libra are grappling with nitty gritty communication and organisational matters. More details below.\nThis eclipse cycle won't recur until 2020, so this is your chance to take the initiative, ask yourself fundamental questions about what you really want to do with this area of your life, and then make the radical decisions necessary.\nThe few days before and after an eclipse are usually fraught, highly strung, rather nervy, with few (except astrology followers) understanding why everyone is so on edge. The eclipse effect carries a major theme for the following six months and will be felt for a few weeks in advance, so there's no sense in delaying until December 4th. Get your thinking cap on.\nIn primitive days, the ancients' view of eclipses was that the darkening of the Sun was a portent of doom, putting them at the mercy of the fates. But these were highly superstitious people, with no sense of control of their lives. Eclipses can provoke crises, bringing unwanted upheavals, but nowadays you can chose your attitude and your strategy.\nSome world leaders have lives which seem eerily to follow eclipses:\nNelson Mandela was imprisoned, released and became President on the exact week of eclipses.\nSaddam Hussein launched and then lost the Gulf War on an extraordinary series of eclipse driven events. He gathered his troops on the borders of Kuwait on the lunar eclipse in late July 1990, two weeks before the solar eclipse on which date the UN mandate to oppose him was agreed. In the following January on the next Solar eclipse, the Gulf War was launched.\nPrincess Diana died one day before a solar eclipse conjunct the potent, furiously angry Mars Pluto conjunction in Virgo in her chart.The previous eclipse in the same series 18.5 years before fell within days of the assassination of the Earl of Mountbatten, Prince Charles' uncle.\nJohn F. Kennedy Jnr was killed in a plane crash days before the major 1999 solar eclipse, which was the same cycle as oversaw the death of his stillborn baby brother and indeed the assassination of his father, two cycles before.\nFor those of us not caught up in world events, the effects are likely to be much less dramatic or tragic, but they are significant if you really want to grow and develop as a human being.\nThis December Solar Eclipse is in a tricky Saros Cycle, usually accompanying a mood of high frustration, intense emotional reactions and a sense of being stuck with circumstances or relationship matters, seemingly beyond personal control. To add to the general feeling of angst, power-hungry Pluto is close to the eclipse, and the dreary Saturn opposition comes a few days later, though admittedly optimistic Jupiter in Leo is trying to add a dash of good luck as well from a trine. Bernadette Brady in The Eagle and the Lark remarks that rash action is inadvisable. GW Bush might do well to pay heed.\nFor most of us these are tough times, with anchors dragging, and generally a sense that life is quite a struggle. Roll on the end of the Saturn Pluto opposition mid 2003, and bring on the joyous eclipses of next year. So it's grit your teeth and make the best of it for now. Here's how:\nSun and Ascendant Sign:\nSAGITTARIUS: An eclipse in your own sign says you are at a crossroads and must chose your path for the next few years. Decisions need to be pondered because there will be no backtracking. Make up your mind, get committed and then get moving. If you look the other way and ignore the eclipse effect, then a crisis in the next few months will force you to see where you have been over compromising. Be independent, don't rely on others for advice, let alone be diverted onto your partner's agenda. It ain't easy, but you do have choices.\nGEMINI: Close emotional and work partnerships and your whole attitude to sharing, caring and relating are under the microscope. You must move into a more co-operative frame of mind, tolerant, flexible and willing to compromise. As an independent, restless air sign, none of this comes naturally. Old relationships may be under strain and on the point of parting company. Do they really suit your needs? Only you know the answer. Strong bonds will weather the storms. New relationships will come as you clear the decks of psychological debris from the past.\nVIRGO: At an outer level, ensuring you have a solid, secure home and domestic base where you can put down roots is your cri de Coeur. At an inner level you are moving away from old ways of relating and refusing to be trapped by family members or loved ones who want you to stay exactly where and as you are. Pushed and pulled by opposing demands from heavy work responsibilities and emotional pressures, you need to put your own needs first. When your dilemma threatens to get on top of you, go dig the garden, walk in nature, or have a Californian massage. Getting in touch with earth energy will help.\nPISCES: Is a career crisis looming? Maybe it's a hint from the universe that you are heading in the wrong direction and trying to fit your talents into the wrong box. You know you want to make your mark on the world, and have your achievements recognised, but you have to be fulfilling what truly feels like a vocation for that to happen. With Pluto around, you will also be questioning your attitude to power figures and who holds the control. Maybe you can't be the megalomaniac you'd like, but you need to ensure that no one else is pulling your strings at work either. Push family responsibilities into their proper place and focus on your ambitions.\nTAURUS: Two things are dear to your heart \u2013 one is money and the other is power (OK and sex is in there somewhere as well). Your sense of security may be shaken because circumstances seemingly outside your control seem to be posing a threat to your power and prosperity base. This solar eclipse falling in the deepest, most hidden area of your chart suggests you need to get right down to rock bottom to find fundamental answers to your present sticky situation. As a fixed sign you expect the world and other people to adapt to you, rather than the other way round. This eclipse says you need to share, care, co-operate and relate in a profoundly different way in future if you are to improve joint finances and spark up your sex life in the months to come \u2013 and avoid a crisis. Hanging on for too much control, could backfire. Trust the universe and go with the flow.\nSCORPIO: Money is on your mind, not joint finances as with Taurus, but your own personal piggy-bank. In the face of ungenerous influences, you know you need to take a major initiative to shake up your finances to bring prosperity in the coming months. Luckily your formidable stamina will stand you in good stead, and Jupiter also helps at your mid-heaven, bringing a hint of career success. But you can't afford to dither around, praying for a lottery win or a long-lost relative to leave you a fortune. Get real, get thinking, and then get working.\nCAPRICORN: A hidden eclipse in the sign before yours sparks up psychological tensions, uncomfortable echoes of unresolved issues from the past and a general feeling of stuck-ness. If you can see the awkward events happening around you as useful pointers, reflections of what is going on at an inner level, then you can make real use of this eclipse. Not naturally an inward-looking sign, you may need to force yourself to ask the probing questions that will bring profound answers. Don't be put off by imagining you will find all manner of horrors. On the contrary you will find you are a richer, stronger personality than you could have imagined. Your unlived emotions tend to put extra strain on your body, so be good to yourself physically by reaching for a deeper self-understanding.\nCANCER: Sagittarius is your area for work and health. You will be facing a dilemma about how to regenerate your career, improve your working conditions and build up your general health. The likelihood with Pluto in place is that you will be meeting resistance in your efforts, but don't let that put you off. Pluto can produce solidly substantial results, but it usually takes a struggle and strong determination. Don't meet unco-operative workmates head on in a stalemate battle. Duck and dive a little. Aim for influence, not outright control. Realise also you have to let go certain old ambitions which have lost their fire. Physically you need to pay better attention to your body's needs, get even minor ailments fixed, and then you will sail ahead in robust form.\nLEO: Love may be on your mind, but it may not be what you are attracting. This eclipse will make you aware of where you are not getting the affection, admiration and adoration you want from loved ones, children or even social mates. Tricky, I know, to be exuberant and utterly seductive with the wet-blanket Saturn-Pluto around. But this is your challenge. You need to allow your personality to shine brightly, to step out without apology or doubt, to be where you feel fulfilled which is centre stage. Two thoughts: one is that what you lack, you must first give. Have you been too meagre in handing out kisses, cuddles and compliments? Go to it. The second is that Pluto tends to make you clutch if you feel you are not getting attention. Let go. If you cage loved ones in, they will struggle to break free.\nAQUARIUS: Always known as the humanitarian sign, this could be your chance to make a real difference to the society or world in which you live. Certainly you know you need to widen your circle of friends and acquaintances in the months, if not years to come, but don't keep stick to a frivolous, exclusively social agenda. You could join hands with influential movers and shakers to have a powerful influence on what is going on around you. You also know you need to nudge yourself into setting long term goals. Don't just think five year plan, think 20 year plan. It doesn't have to be set in concrete, you can adapt as you go along, but you will be better with a broad strategy and well defined goals.\nARIES: Travel, communication, improving your mind \u2013 all of these are sparked off by this eclipse, which is generally prompting you to broaden your horizons in whichever you can. Set your sights higher. Let your imagination soar. Think big, don't get bogged down in trivia. Saturn Pluto is hardly an exciting or inspirational overlay, but nonetheless this is your challenge. You need to spread your ideas to a wider audience, find more intellectual stimulation and see where you can get yourself out of a rut.\nLIBRA: Sorting out your everyday schedule may not sound like a bundle of fun, but if you don't get a grip of minutiae, details and organization, then your life will lack a solid, realistic base. Think about how you communicate. Are you being misunderstood at work? Collect your thoughts first, speak simply and then double check to make sure your message got across. It may not be the content that's at fault, more the delivery.Start each day with a checklist and you won't race round in circles getting in a muddle. Think small for a few months, then you will fly the higher come next May.\nMarjorie's new book The Astrological History of the World (Sterling Publications; ISBN\n", "index": [[2139, 2152], [3455, 3466], [3636, 3645], [4076, 4087], [4142, 4151], [4278, 4283], [4288, 4294], [4334, 4340], [4345, 4352], [4371, 4380], [4385, 4391], [4423, 4426], [4431, 4439], [4484, 4489], [5610, 5624], [5702, 5716], [5744, 5752], [5847, 5853], [5947, 5949], [6040, 6048], [6072, 6077], [6151, 6155], [6177, 6182], [6803, 6814], [7098, 7104], [7169, 7176], [7180, 7183], [7281, 7285], [7327, 7334], [7673, 7684], [8209, 8215], [8766, 8771], [9303, 9314], [10025, 10031], [10895, 10902], [10954, 10960], [11213, 11220], [11446, 11455], [12242, 12253], [13004, 13007], [13814, 13822], [14791, 14797], [15700, 15704]], "wikipedia_ids": [5024887, 66111, 226307, 11474698, 226307, 4415781, 2411229, 11457032, 26933, 3055902, 105219, 11461092, 4415813, 6313604, 21492751, 29490, 182000, 7515890, 31769, 182000, 24095, 14640471, 4415781, 66111, 44474, 38930, 11461092, 150261, 3414021, 11474698, 4415777, 4415781, 5407, 11457032, 26933, 11457032, 38930, 3055902, 11474698, 11461092, 4415813, 44474, 14919], "wikipedia_titles": ["Solar eclipse", "Saros (astronomy)", "Ascendant", "Sagittarius (comics)", "Ascendant", "Virgo (astrology)", "Pisces (astrology)", "Taurus (Marvel Comics)", "Scorpius", "Zodiac (comics)", "Cancer", "Leo (comics)", "Aquarius (astrology)", "Aries (character)", "Nelson Mandela", "Saddam Hussein", "Gulf War", "Kuwait", "United Nations", "Gulf War", "Diana, Princess of Wales", "Mars", "Virgo (astrology)", "Saros (astronomy)", "Saturn", "Jupiter", "Leo (comics)", "Lark", "George W.

In the typical state, 22 percent of people in working families suffer from economic hardship because their earnings and income from other sources, including public work supports and other public benefits, fall below the basic needs budget standard for where they live. By comparison, only 12.6 percent of Americans live below the federal poverty line.The report, \u201cWorking Families and Economic Insecurity in the States: The Role of Job Quality and Work Supports,\u201d synthesizes previous CEPR research using a new approach for measuring economic insecurity that addresses the major limitations of the poverty line and analyzes the state of economically insecure families across 45 states and the District of Columbia. To determine how much income a working family needs to \"make ends meet\", the authors of the report use basic family budgets that take into account the actual costs of goods and services needed to have a decent standard of living, as well as the variations in these costs, depending on where one lives.The researchers also examined the role of public work supports- programs such as child care assistance, the Earned Income Tax Credit, food stamps, health insurance provided through Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, housing assistance, and income supplements provided through Temporary Assistance- in helping families achieve economic security.\u201cWhen measuring poverty, the government and most researchers do not take into account most public work supports,\u201d said report co-author Rebecca Ray. \u201cBy contrast, when we determine whether a family is able to make ends meet, we take into account the value of all of these benefits.\u201dThe report also shows that most economically insecure workers have jobs that pay low wages and provide few or no benefits or \u201cbad Jobs\u201d. Only a minority of jobs nation-wide are \u201cgood jobs\u201d, in other words, ones that pay at least $17 an hour and provide health and retirement benefits.\u201cPublic work supports play an important and largely unheralded role in promoting economic security and opportunity for working families,\u201d said Shawn Fremstad, co-author of the report and Director of Bridging the Gaps, a CEPR initiative.\u00a0 \u201cIn the typical state, work supports close more than half of the hardship gap\u2014the gap between a working family\u2019s income and the basic family budget for where they live\u201d.The authors of the study point out, however, that substantial numbers of workers in low-paid jobs receive only modest or no help from work support programs.According to the report, which uses data from the 2001-2003 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)\nand the basic family budgets\ndeveloped by the Economic Policy Institute, the monthly income of the typical economically insecure family varies from $12,775 a year in Arkansas to $25,047 a year in New Hampshire. The findings of the report also point to a correlation between the number of good or bad jobs and economic security on a state-by-state basis.\u00a0 The full report can be found here (PDF).###The Center for Economic and Policy Research is an independent, nonpartisan think tank that was established to promote democratic debate on the most important economic and social issues that affect people's lives.

It\u2019s disappointing and unfortunate that we have to deal with this in the middle of the season. \u201cIt is what it is, so right now as a team we have to focus on the things we can control, and we have a very challenging game here against a very talented opponent in Florida. We have to get ready to play the game.\u201dGrant suspended Green, Releford and Steele indefinitely just before Saturday\u2019s loss at LSU for violating team rules, sending them packing for Tuscaloosa before tipoff.That was also the second game of Mitchell\u2019s suspension.The disciplinary actions left the Tide (16-8, 5-5 Southeastern Conference) without players responsible for 69 percent of its scoring, 57 percent of rebounding and 54 percent of assists at a time when the stakes are ratcheted up. Green and Mitchell are the team\u2019s top scorers and rebounders, while Releford leads Alabama in assists and Steele is a key role player.Grant said his decision to hold the players out had much to do with the long-term quality of the program and trying to build \u201cthe values and standards that you want your team to represent.\u201d He hasn\u2019t elaborated on the reasons for the suspensions.Grant declined to say if the violations of Mitchell and Green were more serious, but reiterated that their suspension remained indefinite.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that, that\u2019s just the way it is right now,\u201d he said.This is the third time Grant has suspended Green, a first-team All-SEC player, during his three seasons, including a three-game string early last season and one game at the end of 2009-10.Grant didn\u2019t rule it out when asked if he had a \u201cthree-strike\u201d policy that might keep Green from returning.\u201cI\u2019ll make some decisions on that later,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now my focus is on getting prepared for Florida.\u201dAlabama had risen to No. 12 in the rankings in December and won three straight before the LSU game.The bold decision on the suspensions was no surprise to Gators coach Billy Donovan, who was Grant\u2019s boss for a dozen years at Marshall and Florida.\u201cI know Anthony Grant about as well as anybody, and I think that he has got incredible integrity and character and knows exactly the way he wants his program run and what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Donovan said.The Tide\u2019s eight remaining players \u2014 half of them freshmen \u2014 managed to come fairly close before losing 67-58 to LSU, with freshman Rodney Cooper scoring 28 points. Alabama had beaten Auburn by 18 points without Mitchell.Now comes a much bigger challenge, even with Releford and Steele.The Gators (19-6, 7-3) opened last March with a 78-51 rout of a Tide team that still had aspirations of winning an SEC title and making the NCAA field.Florida is also short-handed, but because of injuries. The Gators won\u2019t have their top subs, forward Will Yeguete (concussion) and guard Mike Rosario (bruised hip), for the game, Donovan\n", "index": [[2425, 2433], [2795, 2805], [2911, 2918], [2940, 2954], [2959, 2972], [3013, 3026], [3051, 3066], [3161, 3176], [3486, 3491], [3788, 3795], [3836, 3841], [3852, 3857], [3859, 3867], [3923, 3926], [3978, 3988], [4036, 4044], [4108, 4131], [4287, 4292], [4297, 4305], [4355, 4363], [4421, 4426], [4667, 4672], [4710, 4718], [4723, 4728], [4906, 4911], [4926, 4931], [4950, 4953], [5071, 5076], [5157, 5162], [5276, 5283], [5375, 5378], [5453, 5466], [5476, 5481], [5510, 5518], [5523, 5530], [5539, 5552], [5721, 5728], [5847, 5850], [5918, 5924], [5946, 5954], [6000, 6008], [6135, 6138], [6160, 6164], [6171, 6178], [6350, 6357]], "wikipedia_ids": [30812226, 57690, 18933066, 29516337, 30957146, 17125894, 30812226, 507399, 17125894, 18933066, 17125894, 29516337, 30812226, 5978520, 105167, 30957146, 79371, 29516337, 30957146, 30812226, 17125894, 17125894, 30957146, 29516337, 17125894, 29516337, 79371, 17125894, 29516337, 18933066, 5978520, 1443634, 17125894, 560365, 18933066, 17125894, 1443634, 5978520, 2846320, 30957146, 30812226, 79371, 507399, 18933066, 1443634], "wikipedia_titles": ["Trevor Releford", "Montgomery, Alabama", "Florida", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Anthony Grant", "Trevor Releford", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Anthony Grant", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Trevor Releford", "LSU Tigers football", "Tuscaloosa, Alabama", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Southeastern Conference", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Anthony Grant", "Anthony Grant", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "JaMychal Green", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Southeastern Conference", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Florida", "LSU Tigers football", "Billy Donovan", "Anthony Grant", "Marshall University", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "Billy Donovan", "LSU Tigers football", "Auburn Tigers football", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Southeastern Conference", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Florida", "Billy Donovan"]}

As you will see below, Frisco, as well as other cities, have been attempting to regulate this issue for some time. However, we all continue to be hampered by the decisions of the Public Utility Commission and the courts of the state of Texas. This paper attempts to provide some historical perspective on this overall issue and also highlight for you some specifics on related cost projections.\nNOTE: Please note that the only cost numbers contained in this report that are confirmed at this point is the cost of burying the Coserv lines along Eldorado. Other numbers are calculated based on the data at hand at the time of completing this report. However, such additional cost projections are fairly conservative based on prevailing market data.\nHistorical Perspective of the Undergrounding Issue:\nThe section attempts to provide you with a high level historical perspective of some of the events that have impacted decisions related to the undergrounding of utilities.\nThe City of Frisco has been attempting to regulate the undergrounding of utilities for a number of years. There have been provisions contained in the Subdivision Regulations for a number of years regarding this matter, some of which have had to be removed due to court cases related to this issue. The City also passed an Underground Utility ordinance a couple of years ago to deal with utility lines along thoroughfares. However, if the city says the developer must bury the lines along thoroughfares and the cost of that burial has to be paid by the developer then the developer will argue they are carrying a disproportionate amount of the cost and/or that the city does not have a valid governmental interest in having the lines buried.\u00c2\u00a0 And if the city says the utility must bury the lines along thoroughfares and the cost of burial has to be paid by the utility then the utility will argue that the cost of burial would have to be passed along to the rate payer thus violating their rate tariff set by the PUC (Oncor) or simply violates their Board adopted rate structure (Coserv). In summary, these recent court cases prevent the city from being able to require the burial of lines unless the city (the tax payer) pays the costs. A quick cost analysis of the impact the Eldorado issue, as well as the overall issue, could have is provided in the next section.\n\u00c2\u00a0Cost Analysis:\nThis section provides a high level review of the estimated cost to address the undergrounding issue. It examines the cost from a neutral perspective of who may have to pay these costs but then also provides an analysis of how that cost, if transferred to the City might impact the tax rate.\nCost Estimate Example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\nEdlorado Parkway:\nApproximately $5,500,000 to bury Coserv lines on both sides of Eldorado Parkway (estimate provided by Coserv Electric, see Attachment #1)\n$5,500,000 \u00c3\u00b7 4.6 miles (approx. 2.3 mi. of right-of-way per side) = ~$1,195,562 per mile\n(This calculation is the estimate to bury the Eldorado Coserv line only and does NOT include the cost of a private easement, boring or burial cost of any additional utilities such as cable. Also, this assumes the cost for the entire length of this section of roadway thus any reduction in length drives up the cost per mile estimate.)\n\u00c2\u00a0Potential Additional Costs:\nThese estimates are based on general market knowledge and could be higher or lower. However, a very conservative approach was taken to completing these estimates.\nItem/Service\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Assumptions\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Estimated Cost\nPrivate Easement\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a015\u2032 easement @ $10sf\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0$1,584,000\nSidewalk\\Landscape\\\nScreening Replacement\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a01 mile of replacement\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0$700,000\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\nCable and\\or Telco Burial 15% of Coserv\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0$825,000\nBoring\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0$Unknown .\nTotal\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 $3,109,000\nIf these additional costs were realized the project cost would total approximately $8,609,000.\nFunding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\nCity \u2013 If the City of Frisco were to assume the cost of burying the Edlorado Coserv line only ($5,500,000), there would need to be an adjustment to the tax rate to cover such cost. Below is an approximation of what that adjustment would need to look like:\n\u00c2\u00a2.01 on Tax Rate generates = $1,264,672, therefore, it would take a \u00c2\u00a2.043 Tax Rate increase to fund the Eldorado Coserv line only.\nBelow is provided an approximation of what a tax rate adjustment would look like if the City of Frisco were to assume all of the projected cost above $8,609,000:\n\u00c2\u00a2.01 on Tax Rate generates = $1,264,672 therefore, it would take a \u00c2\u00a2.068 Tax Rate increase to fund the Eldorado Coserv line only.\nUnderground Utility Fees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Why not pay for this from the fees that have already been collected from the Underground Utility Fee Ordinance? First, we only have a total of $368,834.00 in the account meaning there is nowhere near enough to complete the project in question \u2013 Eldorado. Second, the majority of the funds we do have are in other \u201cUtility Zones\u201d defined in the Ordinance which means the majority of the funds are not eligible to be spent on the Eldorado project because they were collected in other \u201cZones.\u201d Third, and most importantly, these funds will more than likely have to be returned to those who paid them due to the enforcement issues with the ordinance outlined in the \u201cHistorical Perspective\u201d section above.\nTariff Change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Oncor has the ability to enter into agreements with cities to pay for undergrounding facilities. These agreements, on a project by project basis, spread the cost of the project across all rate payers in the city. However, there are a number of issues with this process that make it a very risky proposition. Not the least of which is the fact that an agreement can be entered into by the city to bury an Oncor line only to have Coserv come right down the same easement with an overhead line. This problem is identified in item #2 below and has already hit the City of Allen. Also, Coserv which is the provider along Eldorado has no such program available.\nProblems that will continue after funding determination has been made (these apply to all such easements not just Eldorado) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\nThis section outlines some of the problems that would continue even after a funding determination is made related to the Eldorado Parkway utility matter.\nThe above cost estimate from Coserv does NOT include burying other utilities currently on the overhead lines such as cable and\\or telephone.\nNo matter the funding source, once a line is buried this action does not prevent another utility provider from coming right down the same easement and putting up overhead lines where the previous lines would just have been buried. This problem exists unless of course the City (the tax payers) pays AGAIN to have the new lines buried. By way of example, if the Coserv lines along Eldorado are buried by the City, then if Coserv wants to upgrade those lines in the future via overhead lines or if another utility provider wants to go in the same location with overhead lines they would have the right to do so unless the City paid to bury them a second time.\nIf Eldorado lines are buried at tax payer expense then what is the next line to be buried, at what cost and do you continue to raises taxes to bury lines? If it cost $5.5 million to bury only (2.3 miles x 2 =) 4.6 miles of line and the city has roughly 77 miles of thoroughfares and if the cost is similar to the line on Eldorado Parkway as outlined above that would equate to approximately $92,058,274 for one side of each thoroughfare. For both sides that would be approximately $184,116,548. Again, none of these numbers account for the \u201cadditional costs\u201d, as outlined above, that may come into play.\nNeighboring City\u2019s Experiences:\nAllen -\nStated that Allen \u201crecently paid to have Oncor put in underground lines along Stacy Road only to have CoServ put up overhead lines along the same section of roadway.\u201d Stated that there really is \u201cno solution to the problem due to the above [problem] and due to when the line needs to be expanded, the city is faced with the choice again of paying or having the line constructed overhead.\u201d\nThey went on to say that if we find the \u201csilver bullet\u201d to be sure to let them know.\nPlano \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\n\u201cOur subdivision ordinance limits the placement of above ground utilities to major thoroughfares (same as Frisco).\u00c2\u00a0 Subdivisions\u00c2\u00a0are occasionally\u00c2\u00a0built along a major thoroughfare without power lines, only to have them installed later.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cSometimes\u00c2\u00a0homeowners complain, but eventually they\u00c2\u00a0come to understand that the utility company has the right.\u201d\nLittle Elm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\n\u201cWe are having identical issues.\u201d Co-Serv has discussed a \u201csecondary feed\u201d needed down to the end of the LE peninsula and that the only way to get there is a parallel line along the south side of Eldorado Parkway (existing overhead is on the north side). \u201cCoServ, and for that matter every other electric utility, takes the position that if you want it under ground, the city is expected to pay 100% of the cost.\u201d\nCoserv Questions and Response Concerning Eldorado and Undergrounding in General:\nQuestions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\n(1) Would CoServ consider adding an additional charge to its customers in Frisco to pay to place its lines along major thoroughfares underground?\n(2) If the answer to 1 is yes, what do you need from the city of Frisco to institute such a charge?\n(3) If the answer to 1 is yes, what do you believe the monthly cost would be per customer?\nResponse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\n\u201cCoServ has been approached by other cities we serve and asked similar questions. Our response thus far has been \u201cno\u201d, because\u2026\n* The cost of underground construction is 3 to 5 times the cost of overhead construction and we have experienced recent dramatic increases in the cost of labor and materials. We\u2019re seeing some underground construction costs in excess of $1 million per mile.\n* There are tremendous logistical challenges with converting overhead to underground, not the least of which is cable and communications attachments, adequate underground easements, scheduling, etc. All of these can be managed, but not easily.\n* At the point we agree with one municipal entity, we should expect to do it with all of them.\nCoServ is willing to sit down with you and/or your designated city representatives and try to plan conversion of overhead to underground facilities. Because of road widening, or other road construction issues, we are frequently confronted with this question. We\u2019d prefer to plan these changes without imposing fees/charges to our members. The issue of fees/charges, as you know, is ultimately a question CoServ\u2019s elected board of directors must address. My understanding of their direction for me is to find ways to convert without raising rates.\u201d\nSummary:\nThe bottom line is that the cost of burying utility line is very high and the available solutions are fraught with problems of their own.\u00c2\u00a0 Additionally, the actions of the PUC and our Texas courts have further exacerbated the problems. On one hand, cities are being told they do not have the authority to regulate this infrastructure forcing it to be underground and on the other hand even if cities fund the undergrounding there is no guarantee that the buried facilities will remain underground thus wasting taxpayers\u2019 dollars.\nAttachment #1\nCoserv Cost Estimate\nFiled Under: Blog, Uncategorized\nPrint\nEmail\nTweet\nRelated posts:\nOnline Utility Bill Payment Restored\nCity Council Meeting \u2013 8/5/2008\nPhone Service Disrupted After Fiber Line Cut By City Contractors; Police Step Up Patrols in Area\nNew County Commissioner Precinct Lines Approved\nCity Council Meeting 11/4/2008\nAbout jeffcheneyJeff Cheney, CPA, Broker Associate\nJeff graduated among the top of his class from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration and a Masters Degree in Public Accounting.

Sri Lanka ended on 223 off 47.4 overs.But Australia's victory, their 13th one-day success in a row and against the 1996 champions, confirmed their all-encompassing dominance in the tournament.They had reached the second round with a maximum 12 points after the first round and now, with 16 points, are guaranteed a place in the last four. At least two teams -- Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe -- cannot match that points total.Earlier Adam Gilchrist had set Australia on their way with an 88-ball 99 before becoming the 13th player in one-day internationals to fall one short of a century.Australia scored at six an over throughout their innings, completely dominating their opponents quicks and spinners.Sri Lanka, however, did not help themselves.Wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara somehow missed the wicket trying to stump Ponting on 16, then missed the stumps again with his gloves after catching a throw with Ponting, on 35, short of his ground.Sri Lanka were forced to try seven bowlers by the 25th over.Ponting lofted Muralitharan for six over long on, then reached his hundred in the 43rd over off 96 deliveries.In reply, Jayasuriya was hit after making a single from five balls and the reply soon unravelled.Marvan Atapattu had the audacity to hit two boundaries off Lee in the 10th over but was then caught and bowled low down for 16 to make it 42 for one and Mahela Jayawardene was then caught for a three-ball duck while Hashan Tillakaratne was bowled by Glenn McGrath and Arnold, on one, fell lbw to Lee\n", "index": [[506, 515], [533, 542], [568, 581], [586, 595], [602, 611], [636, 643], [701, 710], [743, 752], [773, 776], [800, 810], [830, 847], [913, 922], [969, 986], [1022, 1032], [1131, 1140], [1173, 1182], [1492, 1501], [1506, 1514], [1557, 1571], [1580, 1589], [1711, 1720], [1884, 1900], [1943, 1950], [2031, 2038], [2067, 2076], [2127, 2134], [2142, 2154], [2247, 2257], [2334, 2349], [2393, 2396], [2487, 2505], [2550, 2569], [2584, 2597], [2630, 2633]], "wikipedia_ids": [374833, 7239, 462001, 894399, 397246, 462001, 374833, 7239, 894399, 26750, 397266, 397246, 30873370, 397266, 397246, 374833, 397246, 759317, 896430, 374833, 374833, 894369, 462001, 462001, 397246, 462001, 20905, 397266, 899031, 894399, 1160688, 896410, 423488, 894399], "wikipedia_titles": ["Australia national cricket team", "Cricket World Cup", "Ricky Ponting", "Brett Lee", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Ricky Ponting", "Australia national cricket team", "Cricket World Cup", "Brett Lee", "Sri Lanka", "Sanath Jayasuriya", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Aravinda de Silva", "Sanath Jayasuriya", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Australia national cricket team", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Zimbabwe national cricket team", "Adam Gilchrist", "Australia national cricket team", "Australia national cricket team", "Kumar Sangakkara", "Ricky Ponting", "Ricky Ponting", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Ricky Ponting", "Muttiah Muralitharan", "Sanath Jayasuriya", "Marvan Atapattu", "Brett Lee", "Mahela Jayawardene", "Hashan Tillakaratne", "Glenn McGrath", "Brett Lee"]}

You bet. An opportunity for little-used walk-ons to get their 15 seconds of of fame in a relatively-full Memorial Stadium? That, too.\nIt won't be flashy. It won't be revealing schematically. But that doesn't mean Nebraska's Red/White Spring Game is bereft of stories. Coaches absolutely want to accomplish something in the three hours they're prowling around Tom Osborne Field looking for players to praise and critique.\nFive things to watch for as Huskers put on their spring show and prepare for their inaugural Big Ten season:\nTrench skirmishes: Defensive coordinator Carl Pelini and defensive line coach John Papuchis haven't sweated too much the absence of end Cameron Meredith and tackle Jared Crick for spring camp. Why? They like the talent and depth behind those two. Along with returning starter Baker Steinkuhler, Thad Randle's made a move to the No. 1s this spring. Eric Martin, by all reports, is wreaking havoc as an undersized defensive end. Chase Rome and Jay Guy have flashed some potential to play next year at tackle. Terrence Moore is working his way back into shape after he suffered an injury in the Holiday Bowl, but he'd start at many Big Ten programs. True freshman Kevin Williams missed a week of spring camp with a foot injury, but he returned Wednesday. Could he get a play or two Saturday?\nThe offensive line, meanwhile, is in transition. Position coaches Barney Cotton and John Garrison emphasized physicality and effort with a young, unproven bunch whose forebearers were manhandled at the end of 2010. Starting tackle Jeremiah Sirles missed spring, too \u2013 but his loss is felt more acutely than Meredith and Crick's absence. Young pups\nTyler Moore (a true freshman) and Jake Cotton (redshirt freshman) made strong moves this spring up the depth chart.\nSo what happens when factions of these units match up against each other? The defensive line should have the edge. But watch guards Andrew Rodriguez and Brent Qvale closely. They're supposed to be the starters next year. Can they hold their own against guys like Randle, Moore and Steinkuhler? Also: Can the young pups \u2013 or Marcel Jones and Yoshi Hardrick \u2013 block Martin?\nTempo: Nebraska won't reveal many of its offensive wrinkles \u2013 or, as wide receiver Brandon Kinnie called it, \u201choo ha\u201d -\nthat it installed over the last week. No stunner. But there's a good chance you'll see the Huskers' new no-huddle tempo. It's been around long enough in college football not to be considered secret or revolutionary. NU wouldn't want to waste the opportunity, either, to see how its quarterbacks handle play calls and game management in front of a large crowd.\nSo what to watch? First, see how the offensive line is handling the speed of the game. They have to be in terrific shape for a no-huddle to be truly effective. Second, watch for which quarterback best embodies the \u201cquick, but not in a hurry\u201d manner that you need to run the no-huddle effectively. The worst thing a quarterback can do is waste a down because he rushed his pre-snap setup and reads. Third, look at the passes thrown out of this tempo. While they'll be vanilla in design, fans should still get a decent flavor for how a rhythm-based passing game relies on timing and placement of throws.\nPlaymakers: Reporters and fans have heard nothing but praise for receivers Jamal Turner, Kenny Bell and Stanley Jean-Baptiste and their playmaking skills. Last year, NU lacked a \u201csomething out of nothing\u201d threat at wide receiver, a guy who could turn a two-yard swing pass into a 25-yard gain. Outside of a few big plays to tight end Kyler Reed, Nebraska also lacked a consistent deep threat.\nSenior Brandon Kinnie is a solid anchor on the field side, a tough-minded, possession receiver who should be the go-to guy near the goal line. But when defenses roll a two-man \u201cbracket\u201d coverage his way, or force his routes back toward traffic \u2013 as Oklahoma did in the Big 12 Championship \u2013 somebody on the other side has to make the defense pay. And Niles Paul isn't over there anymore. A big play or two out of the above trio would be a confidence boost heading into the summer.\nCarnes vs. Green: With quarterback Taylor Martinez getting limited action in the Spring Game because of lingering ankle and toe injuries \u2013 those need to heal up over the summer, as reports out of practice suggested Martinez still wasn't quite \u201cright\u201d - and Kody Spano out too, Saturday boils down to an intriguing battle between junior Cody Green and redshirt freshman Brion Carnes. Last Saturday, Carnes had his best scrimmage yet, while Green has turned some heads in camp with improved passing mechanics. How do they perform with a crowd watching?\nGreen had a perfunctory-at-best Spring Game last year, as his attempt to snatch the job from Zac Lee passed by the boards. What about this year? As much as coaches want to play down the Spring Game, Green can make a statement with a strong performance.\nCarnes has the tools \u2013 he just needs the polish. Watch his passing motion for efficiency and enjoy his playmaking abilities outside of the pocket. Odds are he does one thing Saturday that neither Green or Martinez don't do well: Throw on the run.\nHustle and Flow: More than ever in the Bo Pelini era, Nebraska's defense will need its linebackers to do many of things linebackers traditionally do. Fit the interior the run. Man up against a lead blocker or a pulling guard. Take a smart drop on a tight end bolting up the seam and make a play downfield.\nAlthough the Huskers have generally hung their hat on an elite front four and even more dominant secondary, Bo and Carl's defense is actually designed to free up the linebackers \u2013 that is, LaVonte David, Sean Fisher and Will Compton \u2013 to make most of the plays.\nWhile all three probably won't play together Saturday, watch for their chemistry when two of them are out there. How do they communicate? How do they flow to the ball on running plays? Big Ten teams like Wisconsin, Iowa and Ohio State force defenses to stay really sound in how they fill gaps and cover all bases. When there's a \u201cbreak\u201d in the fit, power running teams have a field day on it.\nNebraska's defense is considerably ahead of the offense. In playmakers. In grasp of scheme. Probably in confidence, too. But watch for those little things anyway. How do Compton and David\n", "index": [[811, 827], [919, 927], [1277, 1288], [1314, 1327], [1400, 1411], [1828, 1840], [1865, 1872], [1897, 1911], [2091, 2104], [2109, 2122], [2345, 2350], [2813, 2825], [2861, 2866], [2868, 2876], [3072, 3079], [3197, 3199], [4109, 4111], [4289, 4297], [4585, 4593], [4687, 4697], [4852, 4867], [5032, 5040], [5461, 5468], [5826, 5834], [5907, 5916], [5922, 5930], [6187, 6194], [6282, 6284], [6289, 6293], [6363, 6376], [6621, 6628], [6640, 6649], [6651, 6655], [6660, 6670], [6829, 6837], [7011, 7016]], "wikipedia_ids": [1866204, 4108481, 15717779, 21322928, 25193039, 335750, 78358, 1795981, 15463374, 11305412, 25193039, 35661240, 30967, 4108481, 159450, 97096, 97096, 4108481, 6321810, 31639363, 29142733, 29142733, 32553603, 29142733, 7973225, 4108481, 159450, 7973225, 15717779, 30181474, 78358, 6197912, 963244, 6000172, 4108481, 30181474], "wikipedia_titles": ["Memorial Stadium (Lincoln)", "Nebraska Cornhuskers football", "Carl Pelini", "John Papuchis", "Jared Crick", "Holiday Bowl", "Big Ten Conference", "Kevin Williams (defensive tackle)", "Barney Cotton", "John Garrison (ice hockey)", "Jared Crick", "Marcel Jones", "Tempo", "Nebraska Cornhuskers football", "Nebraska Cornhuskers", "Nu (mythology)", "Nu (mythology)", "Nebraska Cornhuskers football", "Oklahoma Sooners football", "Niles Paul", "Taylor Martinez", "Taylor Martinez", "Zac Lee", "Taylor Martinez", "Bo Pelini", "Nebraska Cornhuskers football", "Nebraska Cornhuskers", "Bo Pelini", "Carl Pelini", "Lavonte David", "Big Ten Conference", "Wisconsin Badgers football", "Iowa Hawkeyes football", "Ohio State Buckeyes football", "Nebraska Cornhuskers football", "Lavonte David"]}

Field Agent then reviews and broadcasts a request to Agents, (iPhone users in the field) who have installed the Field Agent App. Agents use their iPhones to collect and return information and get paid for the service.\nPayments can range from $3 to $8, depending on the job\u2019s degree of difficulty.\u201cNow more than ever, companies are looking for ways to efficiently gain field intelligence on products and services,\u201d said Kelly Miller, Co-Founder of Field Agent. \u201cIn an economy where unemployment is near record levels, it\u2019s rewarding to be part of an idea that can create income for thousands of people.\nMost jobs are in everyday locations where Agents live. Information requested by Clients might include: retail pricing and display information, event images, photos of items for sale and consumer surveys that can be completed anywhere an iPhone can be used.\nField Agent uses the built-in tools of the iPhone to provide accurate and relevant information that is transmitted back to Clients. Agent history, GPS location, time and date stamps and photo confirmations are all ways to ensure data is returned to Clients accurately with verification.\nWhat\u2019s more, Clients and Agents will help us refine the many uses we\u2019ve not even thought of,\u00a0 said Miller. \u201cWe see a lot of potential with this app, where Clients will help us identify new solutions where Field Agents can play a key role in delivering data\u201d.\nAccording to Miller Field Agent is designed to have thousands of Agents ready to gather information and offer feedback on products and services at a moment\u2019s notice. That is a powerful business tool!\n\u201dField Agent is a joint venture between Mill Creek Software and North Star Partnering Group, based in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

I wonder if there is a difference between \u201cmuftah\u201d as shown in the vocab list and \u201cmiftah\u201d.\nI only know the latter version with kasrah for \u201ckeys\u201d.\nMounia says:\nSaturday at 4:40 am\nThat\u2019s a good point Anitagomez. The difference is regional. The word for \u201ckey\u201d in Standard Arabic is indeed \u201cmiftaaH\u201d (\u0645\u0650\u0641\u0652\u062a\u0627\u062d) with a kasra as you mentioned. However, in some countries in the Middle East, people pronounce it \u201cmuftaaH\u201d when they speak.\nKelly says:\nFriday at 1:17 am\nI\u2019ve noticed that in the female \u201cyou\u201d form, sometimes the word is transcribed with an \u201ca\u201d sound at the end but is pronounced without it, or vice versa. For example, in today\u2019s lesson, there was the word \u201ctadhhabiina\u201d but I didn\u2019t hear the \u201ca\u201d sound at the end of it. How do I know when to pronounce the \u201ca\u201d sound and when not to?\nThanks!\nMounia says:\nMonday at 8:55 pm\nHi Kelly,\nThat\u2019s a really good question. Sorry for the late reply.\nIn the feminine \u201cyou\u201d form (\u0623\u0646\u0652\u062a\u0650), verbs end with a fatHa, or the sound \u201ca.\u201d For example: \u201cyou go\u201d, \u2018anti tadhhabiina (\u0623\u0646\u0652\u062a\u0650 \u062a\u064e\u0630\u0647\u064e\u0628\u064a\u0646\u064e),\nor \u201cyou do\u201d, \u2018anti turiidina (\u0623\u0646\u062a\u0650 \u062a\u064f\u0631\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0646\u064e).\nUsually, when the verbs are followed by another word, then we pronounce the grammatical ending \u201ca.\u201d Otherwise, it\u2019s optional and some native speakers choose not to pronounce the \u201ca\u201d sound when the phrase ends with the verb. It sounds more natural.\nFor example: \u2018anti tadhhabiina \u2018ilaa al-madrasa (you go to school) but I can say\n\u2018\u2019 \u2018ayna tadhhabiin?\u201d (where do you go?)\nOr,\u201d \u2018anti turiidiina qahwa\u201d (you want coffee). But I can say, \u201cmadhaa turiidiin?\u201d (What do you want?)\nNote that in all cases, the Haraka \u201ca\u201d is present but we tend to pronounce it more when verbs are in the middle of a sentence.\nLeave a Reply\nName (required)\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\nWebsite\nEmail me follow-up comments to this post.\nPlease note: JavaScript is required to post comments.\nCreate a Free Lifetime Account\nAbout our Printer-friendly lesson notes\nFollow along to our award winning lessons with detailed PDF Lesson\nNotes!

That is starting to change. Earlier this year, the ABC launched three new socially networked digital radio websites which aggregate content from several different sources, including MusicBrainz, YouTube, Last.fm and Wikipedia. It is not only a new approach for a content-rich organisation such as the ABC, it is a working example of the possibilities of Semantic Web technology.\nWritten by Georgina Swan \u2022\n11 Oct. 09 14:42\nTelstra off-shoot dishes up AI\nWhen New Zealand pizza franchise Hell Pizza made the journey across the Tasman to set-up shop in Brisbane, it needed to get noticed fast.\nWritten by Kathryn Edwards \u2022\n27 May 09 14:38\nPlanning Helps Data Centre Move Go Smoothly\nIt isn't often that you have access to your local neighborhood data centre, literally a few steps down the block.

Well today it happened before we took the city bus tour. As we queued for the buenosairesbus.com tour the suntan cream was running into my eyes and one of my friends said \u2018Dont Cry\u2019 to which the reply was \u2018for me Argentina\u2019. Sad I know but there you go.\nSo I finally made it down into the centre of Buenos Aires. The city bus tour looked like a good option if I was going to try and avoid being mugged, robbed, beaten up, raped, shot, stabbed and dumped in a skip.\nAs Ive mentioned previously I had a whole shot list of photo ideas that I wanted to do but talking to my friends here in the current climate it would probably at best end up with me coming home several kilos of camera equipment lighter and at worst several kilos of body parts lighter.\nGoing round on the tour bus Im not saying that my friends were being overly cautious but based more on travelling between tourist areas than the tourist areas themselves.\nThe bus is one of those hop-on hop-off affairs and it takes about 3 and a half hours to do the circuit, we had all day and it was dull and overcast in the morning. Typical, the day I\u2019m fit and well enough to go out and do a major photo session its the first real overcast day we\u2019ve had. Of course the weather forecast for the rest of my stay in BA is thunderstorms so manana doesnt really quite cut it\nSo the plan was to be completely sad and stay on the bus for the first circuit and see if the weather improved. This involved no more effort than sticking the elbow out of the side of the bus and lying back. Of course sticking the elbow out of the side of the bus was precisely how I got a perfect triangle of peeling tan on my left elbow. by now of course this is now redder and deeper but thats another story.\nThe first thing I noticed about our newly arrived open top bus was that it wasnt open topped. There had been some rain the day before and people got wet and complained and tried to get their money back. The bus company had then put the bolt on rooves on. Great to stop you getting wet, rubbish if you want to sit at the top of the bus and look all around you. To those people who complained about getting wet in the rain on an open topped bus I can probably guess your nationality, but sure come to Belfast, our open top busses have a forcefield that deflects rain so you can see all around you in the worst weather. Just remember its pay in advance and absolutely no refunds and dont beleive everything you read on the internet.\nSo of course I managed to pick the wrong side of the bus, the row with no working headphones and even if they were the speakers behind me blasting out the spanish tour information would have drowned them out anyway. No-one thought to think that the high volume setting might need to come down a bit now theres a roof on.\nBut still very little to see in the dull grey light anyway and even less to photograph.\nAfter about 3 or 4 stops of the hop on hop off tour no-one had hopped on or hopped off. I thought we were going to be the only saddos doing this but it turned out that the scare stories had indeed pervaded all of the visiting society who deemed it safer just to sit on this bright yellow bus. For those reading and if you are ever in the same situation, the left hand side of the bus is best, probably about 2 or 3 rows from the loudspeakers at the back. Judging by the number of tree branches crashing off the roof a crash helmet wouldnt be a bad idea, but definitely sunglasses. Thats todays health and safety announcement over.\nI love watching people and I had a real treat on this trip, in front of me was a tourist couple, German, who sat over two rows of two seats, both at the window side one behind the other. For most of the trip they sat with their backpacks on the spare seats beside them. People would come up to the top deck to look for free seats and they both would ruffle about in their bag to take up as much space as possible. You rarely see such coordination outside of the synchronised swimming in the Olympics. The old man in front had a wee point and shoot camera with a big screen so it would be rude of me not to look at what he was shooting. All I can say is dirty old man. Every time we stopped he would use the high vantage point to zoom down on some really good looking tanned womans cleavage and take a photo. Im describing this in great detail for research purposes only. I dont know if his wife was aware, didnt know, didnt care whatever but firstly I thought what a sleaze, secondly I thought I really should have brought my point and shoot (to blend in and be safe you understand, not to look down womens cleavage). Anyway at one point in the tour outside Recoleta these two stunningly beautiful tall blonde women came up to the top of the bus and had a look round for seats (either German or Scandinavian or similar). The old guy couldnt lift his bag off the seat quick enough, Im sure he was verging on hernia territory he moved that quickly. But they took one look and moved down the bus. Following them up the stairs were two huge black guys and our hero couldnt get the bag down in time before one took up residence beside him. I must have seemed a right idiot laughing away to myself.\nDriving round on the bus we got to see pretty much all the tourist sites and spots, in complete contrast to my previous experience, BA is a beautiful city, full of wide avenues, mixtures of old colonial buildings, modern architecture, european with a hint of not. The commercial area is pretty much the same as any commercial area in any big city in the world and down here it was the first I\u2019d seen of multinationals and billboard type advertising. Again little to separate the place from most other world cities.\nIts the quirky nature of some places, the old decaying buildings, the former rich family palaces who when they fell on hard times sold out to foreign governments so there is an area filled with some of the best looking embassies in the world.\nIts not really a walk around city as a lot of it is very spread out (as the 3 and a half hour bus tour with only 12 stops) would tell you, but there are areas that it looked like it would be very safe to walk around. Its a strange mix, one of the locals told me theres no real middle class, just rich and poor and this certainly seems to be borne out travelling round. The bus tour mainly goes through rich areas but down around La Boca it goes through areas the police had told me not to walk through. Of course these are the areas with the friendliest people, waving and smiling at the people on the bus.\nThe weather was picking up as we finished our first circuit so we decided to stay on the bus and go round again and get off at Recoleta, famous for us primarily as the area containing the Recoleta cemetary and the tomb of Evita Peron. The bus stops outside the tourist office and theres a half hour wait before it continues so we chatted and I decided to get off the bus, get some photos of the nearby Plaza De Mayo before we set off. Of course the driver and guide had nicked off for a mate and a smoke so we were locked in, something they dont tell you so be warned\nSo at this point I have a confession to make, well not a confession of sorts but more an explanation of how we work. I love getting all the tourist literature from a place and going through all the photos and comparing whats in the brochures to whats actually there. For example, if I want to photograph a place in Ireland at dawn I would scout out the location, pick a good morning with relevant clouds, pick area, pick spot, get there well before dawn, get photos, come home, review etc etc. This might take 2 or 3 goes due to changing weather conditions, some moron has parked a white van in the wrong spot\nor any multitude of things. So the finished images could have taken weeks of research and maybe a couple of years to get the right sort of conditions.\nNone of which you are going to see speeding past in a big yellow bus. You might but its highly doubtful. Its like the city tour, coming mid summer isnt going to be a good idea, going over midday isnt a good idea, certain buildings will look better in the morning, or evening or in the case of the Theatro Colon, in May when they take the scaffolding down! Im glad there isnt a trade descriptions act for tourism or Id be permanently in court.\n\u2018Your honour, exhibit A, the Giants Causeway\u2019\n\u2018Your honour, exhibit B, what we saw, mist\u2019\nSo bearing that in mind and taking a more realistic view of the descriptions of Recoleta cemetary I went forearmed.\nI have to say though, it lived up to every single description. The cemetary is for the rich and famous of Argentina, its described as a city of the dead, with streets, walkways, ornate buildings. No-one is buried underground (at least that I could tell) and the whole place is a show of wealth and status, even when you are dead. Every word is true, Ive never seen the like of it before. Well organised and laid out, the equivalent of coffin multistoreys in some cases. Glass doors with small rooms with coffins neatly stacked and laid out. It seems strange for someone used to burying people in the ground or burning them to see them laid out in a small living room type environment. Some coffins hundreds of years old, in most cases perfectly preserved. In some tombs the marble has broken and bits of coffin sticking out here or there adds to the slightly eerie feeling when you find an avenue not populated by tourists. We spent time wandering around and avoided the headlong rush to Evitas tomb. One of my friends has a family burial plot there that they have never seen and we found it. A distant relative was a general in the army and judging by the size of the tomb was very well off indeed and very well thought of judging by the number of plaques.\nWandering back I just kept an eye out for a queue of tourists and sure enough found evitas tomb. In relative terms it is quite modest compared to some there but probably the most famous for non-Argentinians.\nThere is a busy market on the hill on the way up to the cemetary, something they dont show you in the tourist brochures of the walls\nIts a place selling all sorts of tourist tat but notorious for pickpockets so watch out.\nThat pretty much sums up the bus tour of BA for me, lots of nice looking places but little in the way of real interest for me. I could have got on and off and did a lot more tourist shots of buildings rather than just drive bys but unlike other cities I do get bad vibes from acting the tourist here. Ideally Id like to take time over things hanging around waiting for decent or the \u2018right\u2019 light to photograph things, take pictures of local people doing local things and generally experiencing the life of the place but with a camera and lens worth more than most people make here in a year, the gulf in society, the massive and unpublished inflation and similarly underplayed unemployment figures I have to realise that I would like to go home in one piece. For me thats the saddest thing about being here, a beautiful city but I suspect there isnt much income from tourism to justify the extra spend making people feel safer. Travel forums are full of stories of tourists being victims of crime and yes the internet gives a voice to the dozen or so people affected, thats not to diminish their plights but there are perhaps thousands that nothing has happened to. Im not a normal tourist though, I carry a lot of expensive equipment, I have two cellphones with me, both of which have never left my room in the apartment. I have a \u2018cheap\u2019 swatch watch that has never been on my wrist since the airport, I cant wear half my travel clothes as they would signal me out as a target. Its something I feel stronger here, again perhaps my friends are being overcautious but as with the kidney stones incident it will be them left to pick up the pieces and I have to bow to their judgement, they are the people who live here and are on the ground day in day out.\nThere are some beautiful photos of Buenos Aires out there, Id come with loads of ideas of how to do them my way but sadly thats not going to be the case, Im sure things will improve here, just as probably things at home might worsen. A friend of mine travelled round the world 10 years ago and has some beautiful photos of places you would never consider travelling to today. Similarly places he couldnt go then have become must sees now.\nThings will change, cruise ships regularly dock in Belfast now, something not considered just 10 years ago.\nI have to say though, if you do get the bus tour and you only decide to hop on and hop off once, do it at Recoleta. It is probably one of the most unique places I\u2019ve ever visited and I say that about very few places I\u2019ve been.\nSpeaking of which, its nearly time to pack to head to Iguazu Falls. Ive just checked the weather forecast for Wednesday and they have a \u2018feels like\u2019 value. In Belfast its normally something like 2C but feels like -5C. For Iguazu its 39C feels like 56C. Poke me with a stick and tell me when I\u2019m done.\nTo see the photos from the Argentina Trip, click here\nSearch Radharcimages\nAdd a comment\nNee nahh nee nahhh\nSearch Radharcimages\nWell it had to happen, the luck had to run out sometime.\nIn the middle of a stock photo shoot on Weds evening I just didnt feel well at all. Suddenly started getting twinges in my lower back. Now Ive had them before but the thoughts of getting sick in another foreign country really didnt appeal. A quick trip to the loo and it confirmed that another bout of kidney stones was on its way rapidly.\nWhen I was a kid I remember my dad being plagued by them so it was likely Id get them at some point. Although looking back you just dont realise the pain people are in until you feel it for yourself.\nThose of you that know me will also know Ive been taking painkillers almost constantly for 11 years now due to an old recurring injury. All that extra calcium probably doesnt help. I have refrained from blogging and facebooking about being painkiller/tablet free due to the heat and humidity for 12 days (until the antihistamine mosquito bites incidents last week) because I knew it would set me up for a fall.\nNow those of you who have had kidney stones know that they can just pass with minor irritation and there are times when it feels like you are trying to piss a concrete block. This was the latter. Within half an hour I was sitting on the floor in a pool of sweat trying to knock the co-codamol into me as quickly as I could manage. After taking the recommended dosage for 8 hours in 15 mins it had eased somewhat enough for me to try getting into the shower. How I thought this would help I didnt know but I certainly wasnt going to get any wetter than I was.\nBy this time my flatmates had noticed my absence and packed up the gear as Id just left the camera on the ground and disappeared.\nI asked them to get me to a doctor.\nAfter 2 hours (well it was probably more like 2 mins) I noticed them in discussion to which the outburst was \u2018what part of get me to a doctor, do you not understand?\u2019 or words to that effect, there might have been slight swearing involved. Well a lot of swearing, infact every 2nd word was f\u2026\nNow Im not one for panicking, I rarely panic and usually in the worst situations can still think logically. The issue my friends had was that they didnt know a doctor, theyd never had call to call one. Not like my poor dad who often commented that a holiday in our house always ended up with one or more of us visiting the local accident and emergency. In fact by the time of any incident my dad could tell you which doctors was open, which hospital was on A+E intake and which local chemist was open on the rota.\nSo, again, interspersed with swearwords I requested my friends to find the nearest flat with old people or with kids as they invariably would know where the nearest doctor was. I also said that the building porter will know. They said he wouldnt and I slightly forcefully told them to at least walk out of the room and pretend they were doing as I asked. Poor guys didnt know what to do, Not even watching rapper videos on MTV had prepared them for the sheer volume of swearing an irishman in excruciating pain can muster.\nWe briefly discussed them looking up my travel insurance company on the web and ringing them for advice. I finally just produced every bit of cash I owned, my credit cards, passport and doubled over in the hall informed them that I was leaving for the nearest hospital and to summon a taxi.\nAt a party earlier in the trip someone here asked me what the people in the rest of the world were like, were they helpful and friendly. I said that no matter where I went people in the main seem always willing to help a stranger. I gave the example in a recent trip to Northern Nicosia I had got lost on the backstreets and my leg pain had increased. I sat down and took a tablet and drank the last of my water with it. Three late teenage or early twenties guys came up to me and I thought \u2018oh shit here we go\u2019. They didnt say anything just smiled and handed me a fruit sweet and walked off. There is nothing like the kindness of strangers, particularly alone far from home.\nWith all the wars and fighting and reasons given for people to kill each other, when you get down to individuals requiring help or just a smile then in most places people will offer it. I suffered horrific injuries in Kenya 11 years ago, injuries that would have left someone local to die but everyone I met was supportive, it wasnt until I reached London that people didnt care. A lesson there perhaps.\nIn what seemed like an eternity a taxi arrived and I was whisked at the speed of light as only taxi drivers know how to do to the local hospital. I was given a number and told to take a seat which was easier said than done. From home experience I expected to wait about an hour to be seen and be doubled up all that time.\nI was seen in less than 10 mins, explained the situation and about 10 mins later had the much needed painkilling injection. 10 mins after that I was sort of back to normal with only the now translucent skin colour that comes with severe pain showing any problem at all. If you havent encountered this phenomenon, lucky you, I dont know the technical reasons but all blood and colour leaves the skin, probably the defense mechanism taking blood away from non-important areas. The only spots of colour I had were now the remaining multiple mosquito bites.\nAnother difference from home was that the doctor sent me for tests to make sure I didnt have an infection and that was all done in an hour and I was sent home with the all clear but told to drink as much water as I could get down me over the next few days and at least whilst I was still in the country.\nSo back in the apartment things started to return to normal. Pain was subsiding and colour was starting to return. I drank about 2 litres of water in the next hour which the guys had prepared for me and tried to get some sleep.\nBy now it was 3am and if things hadve been normal Id have been getting up at 6am to set off on my pre booked day trip to Colonia Del Sacremento, Uruguay.\nBeing the idiot I am and having been through this experience a couple of times before at home I thought, ah sure I\u2019ll get up at 6am anyway and see how I feel\u2026.\nI cant finish this posting without giving my thanks to my flatmates Gaspar, Juan and Luis whose role in all the above is portrayed humourously but who showed that despite language differences, despite cultural differences that there is kindness in strangers the world over. I appreciate everything you did for me lads, muchas gracias amigos.\nAlso thanks to the hospital staff at the hospital whose name I still dont know, who like hospital staff everywhere are overwork and under appreciated by the people who have never been unfortunate enough to have required their services.\nTo see the photos from the Argentina Trip, click here\nSearch Radharcimages\n1 comment\nThe Dangers of Travel Photography\nSearch Radharcimages\nThis is very much a case of do as I say, not as I do.\nWe are all well aware of the dangers of travel photography. I often like a wingman/wingwoman/wingperson to watch my back in a strange place whenever Im concentrating on camera stuff and actually taking photos. Its either that or the one setting get the camera out take the photo and put it back again which never really does the job properly.\nHaving been brought up in a rough area I like to pride myself on seeing and recognising a hood/crook/criminal no matter where I am in the world but it always pays to be careful. The less time an expensive camera is on show the better. One advantage of being rather scruffy in general is that people tend not to bother you. Its particularly good when you look like you havent eaten in a while.\nMy dad told me about how he went into London one night and won a lot of money on the dogs, he was standing in the underground early in the morning on a deserted platform with the money in his pocket. A group of guys arrived and my dad having worked in a bookies for a long time knew these guys would be up to no good. So he put 10 pence in his hand and walked across to one of the litter bins on the platform. He bent down and pretended to pick it up off the floor then proceded to go to the nearby chocolate bar machine and buy a bar. He shoved it into his mouth as if he hadnt eaten all day. He looked around and the guys had left, probably thinking he wasnt worth the bother. Theres definitely a lesson there.\nIf you are travelling on your own try to blend in, not get noticed (which is difficult when you are carrying a great big camera), look as if you belong there and you know what you are doing.\nDont associate with idiots and canon fodder. What do I mean by that? Well I was travelling with friends by train once through the south of france. It was early in the morning and as we waited to get off the train we were approached by a guy wearing just his socks, boxers and t-shirt.\n\u2018Do you speak english?\u2019\n\u2018No we dont\u2019\n\u2018Ok ok, do you know anyone who does\u2019\n\u2018we are only kidding you\u2019\n\u2018oh ok, do you know where the rest of the train is?\u2019\n\u2018what?\u2019\n\u2018the rest of the train, I woke up during the night, went to the toilet, fell asleep in the toilet, woke up, went back and the rest of the train wasnt there\u2019\n\u2018Oh you mean the back half of the train that was on its way to Madrid\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\n\u2018Its probably in Madrid\u2019\n\u2018where is this part going?\u2019\n\u2018Milan we think but we are getting off here\u2019\n\u2018If I get off here do you think my mate will know where to come and get me, hes got the passports, money, clothes, rucksacks\u2019\nNow at some point you have to feel immense pity, you feel like helping the guy out and taking him under your wing. Alternatively you can just run away and remind yourself of Darwins theories.\nOne other time I was on a bus in Rome and this girl was giving her what I assume was a boyfriend such earache at such a high volume it wasnt hard to be nosey. To cut the long story short they had been walking down this backstreet in Rome which they shouldnt really have been on when he was approached by a beautiful early 20s woman. She walked right up to him with a big kiss and started to fondle his nuts (and I dont mean peanuts). The guy of course was just happy to go along for the ride but suddenly she walked off when another female friend appeared.\nThe girlfriend at the time was too gobsmacked to say anything and our hero was in no fit state to argue. That was until he discovered that his bumbag (fannypack) was empty and hed lost their money, passports, room keys, everything.\nSo for the entire bus journey back to the centre of town he and the rest of the bus was reminded about how stupid he\u2019d been. I cant really describe the look on his face, he was taking a lot of abuse and whilst he showed shame and embarrassment there was still a trace of a smile on his face.\nSo let that be a lesson to you all, either hide your valuables or buy a shedload of cheap wallets from china on ebay, fill them with newspaper cuttings and get a cheap flight to Rome and have the week of your life.\nSo what has all this got to do with photography? Well I did say at the start, do as I say, not as I do.\nI\u2019ll go back to a recent trip to Rome. On the last night it was a clear evening so I thought I\u2019d head to the Vatican and get some late night shots of St Peters Square with maybe a few people ghosting through the shots but try to get most without people.\nSo I got to St Peters Square and as I was travelling light I\u2019d no tripod, so just put my backpack on the ground and put the camera on the top. It was a still night so wind movement wouldnt be a problem so I just attached the cable release to the camera and lay down behind it all to see through the viewfinder to line it all up.\nAt this point I heard some footsteps behind me and thought, oh crap Ive\n", "index": [[1110, 1119], [1370, 1379], [1456, 1468], [1625, 1628], [1936, 1938], [3392, 3399], [4760, 4766], [5154, 5162], [5821, 5829], [5948, 5954], [6044, 6046], [6488, 6490], [7543, 7550], [8604, 8611], [9406, 9408], [9465, 9467], [9663, 9671], [9805, 9814], [10049, 10052], [11428, 11430], [13179, 13191], [13203, 13205], [13634, 13641], [13797, 13805], [13972, 13984], [13986, 13989], [14077, 14084], [14544, 14547], [14819, 14821], [14986, 14989], [15990, 15992], [16378, 16380], [17311, 17314], [18596, 18601], [18727, 18733], [20240, 20242], [20335, 20342], [21425, 21427], [22050, 22056], [23055, 23061], [24045, 24049], [24245, 24249], [25205, 25209], [25271, 25275], [25445, 25449], [25521, 25528], [25562, 25578], [25678, 25694], [26063, 26066]], "wikipedia_ids": [18951905, 18951905, 255919, 465931, 55951, 5046, 11867, 22576, 1618186, 11867, 55951, 156992, 779194, 147575, 55951, 364578, 1618186, 18951905, 465931, 156992, 255919, 364578, 5046, 1618186, 48312, 465931, 5046, 465931, 364578, 465931, 364578, 55951, 18856, 188171, 17867, 364578, 31843, 55951, 17867, 5843419, 25458, 25458, 130495, 25458, 25458, 32408, 894041, 894041, 465931], "wikipedia_titles": ["Argentina", "Argentina", "Buenos Aires", "Jony Ive", "Instant messaging", "Belfast", "Germany", "Olympic Games", "Recoleta, Buenos Aires", "Germany", "Instant messaging", "Bachelor of Arts", "La Boca", "Ireland", "Instant messaging", "Identity document", "Recoleta, Buenos Aires", "Argentina", "Jony Ive", "Bachelor of Arts", "Buenos Aires", "Identity document", "Belfast", "Recoleta, Buenos Aires", "Iguazu Falls", "Jony Ive", "Belfast", "Jony Ive", "Identity document", "Jony Ive", "Identity document", "Instant messaging", "MTV", "Kenya", "London", "Identity document", "Uruguay", "Instant messaging", "London", "France", "Rome", "Rome", "EBay", "Rome", "Rome", "Vatican City", "St. Peter's Square", "St. Peter's Square", "Jony Ive"]}

All over the nation people will be getting together for a day of revelry, barbecuing, fairs, parades, concerts and baseball games. Clearly this is an important day, a day to bring your game face and show your neighbors that you too continue to hold an unreasonable predilection for hating Great Britain and the red coats of yester-century. It\u2019s imperative then, that on such an esteemed day you are as well prepared to party as Paul Revere was for his midnight ride.\u00a0 Here\u2019s some crucial items you absolutely must have to ensure that your 4th of July celebration goes off without a hitch:\nFireworks Popcorn Giftbox: We would of course never advocate using or even owning dangerous and illegal fireworks, but with this fireworks themed popcorn, you can make all the noise without any of the catastrophe or lost limbs. This particular set features four succulent varieties of \u201cA\u201d grade American popcorn grown right in the heartland. You can almost hear the Star-Spangled banner as you crunch down.\nCabela\u2019s Blue Ridge Flintlock Rifle: Yes fellow patriots, this is an accurate, working replica of a Revolutionary War era rifle, the same kind that was used to run the hated Brits back into the sea. Rest assured you\u2019ll be the life of the party with this baby slung across your back. Extra points if you convince your family (or friends, or dog) to reenact a line battle. Just don\u2019t point it anything you don\u2019t intend to absolutely annihilate.\nAmerican Flag Shirt: No 4th of July outfit would be complete without an American flag shirt. Its rumored that George Washington himself wore an American flag shirt when he defeated King George III in an arm-wrestling contest. For those with a discerning sartorial inclination, this iconic item can be found in a variety of styles and designs, so no excuses.\nAnswers\nWhat are the different styles of American flag shirts for this Independence Day?\nIf you\u2019re not sure what to wear on Independence Day this year you do have a few options. There are differences in women and men\u2019s options when it comes to American flag shirts. Here are the different styles for men and women.\nMen\u2019s American flag shirts\n-A simple t-shirt with an American flag on it is the easiest style of wearing an American flag shirt on Independence Day. All you need is tennis shoes, a pair of jeans and a hat. Men can also get a button-up collared shirt. This can be paired with a cowboy hat, jeans and boots.\nWomen\u2019s American flag shirts\n-Women seem to have more options when it comes to choosing an American flag shirt. Women can wear tank tops or t-shirts with an American flag printed on it. There are many more styles and prints of the American flag for women to choose from when picking out their Independence Day attire.\nAnswered by Jennifer 5 months ago\nContribute\nJoin our bloggers and become a contributor\nWelcome to our shopping guide with exciting news and tips, reviews, questions, and articles about american flag shirt.

I liked the diy program and I think as much is it would be nice to plunk money down on the Chevy Volt or the Ford Focus EV I'm not sure that the Volt is something I can afford and the Ford Focus is a way for Ford to reach the new EPA mileage standards for the US fleet while still holding onto the huge Ford Expeditions and the like. If Ford can build just enough EVs to tip the balance in its favor it can continue with business as usual. Ford doesn't even have to sell them to the public. They can sell them only to commercial car fleet purchasers and exclude the general public. No wonder they don't want any bail out money. What car company wants its CEO fired and then to be told that it can no longer make anymore Fuel Sucking Pigs or FSPs as we call them here.\nSo I was gratified to hear John \"Plasmaboy\" Wayland talk about and advocate common sense strategies for converting to electric with out the appeal to magic batteries or free energy ponzie schemes to power the cars. One thing I would probably beg to differ with John on though is that he said that modern cars would be more difficult to convert and he discouraged it. I think this is wrong for\u00a0three reasons.\nFirst, newer cars are safer cars. Older cars like the Volkswagen Rabbit of the 1980s have no airbags, reinforced steel doors or\u00a0headrests that absorb whiplash\u00a0and are therefore death traps in a car accident. It's not a trivial matter here in the US because upwards of 32,000 people die per year in accidents. Part of it is undoubtedly due to the driving while cellular syndrome which is a pox on the nation.\nSecond, newer cars do not have to be harder to convert. I saw a website of a beautifully converted electric Yaris that I drooled over. It was so well done it looked factory. The Yaris came out around '06 so it has all the CANBUS paraphernalia in it and yet it was converted successfully with the best parts availably like a Netgain Warp 9 series DC motor, a 1000 amp Cafe Electric Zilla controller and Exide blue maintenance free batteries. The car was brand new when it was converted so it can be done if you choose a car without all the bells, whistles and goo-gahs onboard. A Yaris fits the bill. http://www.go-ev.com/Mark_Dutko_Album_files/\nThird, with the exception of the Chevy S-10 which is still an excellent conversion choice even if GM goes into the drink, most of the older cars that John talks about converting like the Rabbit of the '80s will undoubtedly have difficulty obtaining replacement parts for things like CV joints, tie rods, springs, tail light lenses,\u00a0seats, etc. So when choosing a car its important to choose one that you can get replacement parts for or you're in for a world of hurt like the president of our EV club was until he found a practically pristine 1980 Plymouth Horizon he could cannibalize for parts for his\u00a0factory converted Horizon called the Jet Electrica 007.\nThere was just one other minor point. I have both books, \"Convert It\" by Michael Brown and the original \"Build Your Own Electric Vehicle\" book by Bob Brant and\u00a0I liked the Bob Brant book more because it explains the advantages of each type of battery and electric motor in detail.\u00a0It also places great emphasis on the proper choice of vehicle to convert based on vehicle curb weight, wind drag coefficient and capacitiy for storing batteries. But then I'm a ham radio operator so I think now you know why I like Brant's book more. But John has a valid point. Michael Brown's book is an easier read and I feel that most people who read the book who have also done shade tree mechanic work, like replacing a steering rack arm or replacing a water pump, can do this.\nRick, From the oil capitol of the world, Houston, TX.\nquote comment\nadd new comment\nRick CovertFree AccessRickCovert said on Wednesday, May 13th 2009 @ 12:44 PM:Nikki,\nOoops! I was wrong on the availability of parts for the Volkswagen Rabbit. It turns out the Rabbit was much loved, (by everyone but me but only because I had to fix my girlfriend's, now my wifes old Rabbit ICE engine when it broke otherwise its a fun car ) and so a cottage industry has evolved around the Rabbit.

He has to take whatever is available.\nSelf Service: The consumer is given the ability to choose between various products or services.\nDIY: Do It Yourself: The consumer starts getting involved in the value chain.\nCo-design: The consumer starts adding value by customizing the product and therefore defining his needs himself (as opposed to buying a product defined by the product management team).\nCo-creation: The consumer is involved in the design of the product or service itself.\nLevels of knowledge\nRaw Data: Data, typically from measurements, or attributes (small, big, expensive, etc...)\nInformation: Data that I can make sense of. Data within a referential or data that can be tied to a process, so that I establish a first level of knowledge. If I can measure, and if I can compare, I will be able to develop a better sense of understanding\nClassification, categorization: When I can better define the context, place the information into categories\nProcess/Time: When you start introducing the concept of time, and evolution over time.\nLogic: When you understand enough of a thing that you can capture this understanding into a logical model. From this comes automation.\nBackground:\nThe story starts at a banker's conference where Xavier was doing a presentation on e-Banking. The room suddenly woke up at the last slide when he offered a model to explain how banks could move forward. The impact was stunning, all of a sudden everybody wanted to jump into the discussion.\nThe model was the result of observations from Swissquote Inc, where intermediaries had become agents of change within the company and had help transform it into a hyperproductive company.\nThe model has since then been refined, with the definition of the \"transformActors\" and \"ConsumActors\", and the classification of knowledge (inspired from Mathematics) and interactivity along the 2 axis of a matrix.\nThe model has also been validated against 3 real cases with 3 Swiss companies: Swissquote, Largeur.com and Cla-Val.\nThe Model\nThe problem:\nlow cost offshoring, baby boomers reaching retirement age, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 create tension in the economy. And the answer is not in lowering costs, but rather in achieving high productivity.\nThe solution:\nchanging Consumers into ConsumActors. We have heard of crowdsourcing, but the real underlying change is that the customers are getting more involved into the value chain.\nTechnologies of Cooperation\nWhile technology helps improve processes, the real value behind these technologies is the shift in the interactivity between the producers and the consumers: consumers are getting used to getting more and more involved into the process (self service, product configuration and customization, etc...)\nLevels of interactivity\nThe level of interactivity that is possible with ConsumActors can be classified as follows:\n4.1 Passive consumption:\nThe consumer is getting products or services with no real interaction and no real choice. He has to take whatever is available.\n4.2 Self Service\nThe consumer is now given the ability to choose between various products or services. This first step is already a huge step forward, as the consumer can go around the vendor to pick and choose what he wants.\n4.3 DIY: Do It Yourself\nAt this level, the consumer starts getting involved in the value chain. This is what IKEA offers, where you are not just buying a product, you are actually also delivering it to your home and building it yourself. This case is an example of the first disruption from the standard retail value chain.\n4.4 Co-design\nAt this level, the consumer starts adding value by customizing the product and therefore defining his needs himself (as opposed to buying a product defined by the product management team). This is what Dell is asking from customers when they have to pick and choose options to build a computer.\n4.5 Co-creation\nThis is the ultimate level of involvement, where the consumer is actually involved in the design of the product or service itself. This is what Open Source does for developers, and what Wikipedia does for knowledge consumers. Similarly Procter and Gamble has a \"Connect and Develop\" program that lets innovators define products.\nLevels of knowledge\nBeing able to interact at the various level listed above requires various levels of access to knowledge. For example co-designing a computer on the Dell website implies that the consumer has a good understanding of the various components and their importance within the system. A slow processor with lots of memory, or a fast processor with very little RAM are not going to be good options.\nAnd then knowledge includes a notion of context that should also be taken into account: knowing that something is small is only useful relative to a context: is Jean small because he is only 4 years old, or is he small because most people his age are typically 5\" tall?\nFollowing these concepts, knowledge can be classified as follows:\n5.1 Basic Knowledge\n5.1.1 Raw Data\nData, typically from measurements, or attributes (small, big, expensive, etc...)\n5.1.2 Information\nInformation is data that I can make sense of. Data within a referential or data that can be tied to a process, so that I can establish a first level of knowledge. If I can measure, and if I can compare, I will be able to develop a sense of understanding: Jean is 4 feet, and I can measure his classmates to decide whether Jean is small or not. From information I can develop basic knowledge.\n5.2 Formal knowledge\n5.2.1 Classification, categorization\nThis second level of knowledge is when I can better define the context. In the example of Jean, I can place the information into categories to reach another level of understanding: boy/girl, small/tall. By defining categories and sub-categories, I can refine the level of knowledge I have.\n5.2.2 Process/Time\nThe third level of knowledge is when you start introducing the concept of time, and evolution over time. This introduces another level of complexity and another level of understanding beyond what can be known now.\n5.2.3 Logic\nThe final level of knowledge is when you understand enough of a thing that you can capture this understanding into a logical model. From this comes automation. This is how we started building calculators, encapsulating logic into a machine, and now expanding to building transistors into microchips to build computers for example. It all seems as if mathematic algorithms were slowly but irreversibly being materialized into automated processes. And we are only at the very beginning of an exponential curve in this area.\n5.3. Informal Knowledge\nAnother type of knowledge that will not be considered in this document, but should be mentioned, is informal knowledge.\n5.3.1 Informal Experience\nThis is knowledge learned from accumulated experience. This is how people learn how to drive for example\n5.3.2 Informal Thinking\nThis is the knowledge from \"soft\" fields, for example philosophical, cultural, religious, moral or ethical knowledge. They should not be ignored since they are at the forefront of the political, social and cultural scene. An expression of this type of knowledge is on display in blogs or reality TV shows for example.\nThe management of Knowledge is what has led to major changes in the way we work today:\nIt all started with the concept of \u201cCommunity of practice\u201d presented by Etienne Wenger on 9/18/88\nIt evolved towards becoming a core engine of the enterprise, with Knowledge Management, to manage both static (as in encyclopedias) and dynamic knowledge (as in knowledge facilitated by groupware, starting with email).\nIt has also now been opened and shared to allow for collective intelligence, benefiting both from internal and external input.\nThe matrix\nUsing the 2 axis that were defined, it is possible to create a matrix that can be used to resolve the issue of transferring production from the producer to the consumer.\nOn the vertical axis:\nData - info - classification/categories - time process - model\nOn the horizontal axis:\nReceive - Self Service - Do It Yourself - Co-design - Co-creation\nTo use the matrix you need to start from the bottom left (data/Receive), to then evolve towards the right to include the consumer into the value chain and define the level of knowledge that needs to be transferred to the consumer to enable his involvement.\nThe matrix can be used for several analytical purposes:\n7.1 Historical analysis - the matrix can be used to compare the result of 2 strategies used at different times, to analyze why one worked better than the other:\nNestle had tried to sell Nespresso through the regular channels without much success. Then they decided to change strategy (break with history) and created the Club Nespresso, where customers are educated and provided with a tool to order directly online, which completely change the buying and consuming experience\n7.2. Market analysis - the matrix can be used to compare the strategy of two different companies on the same market:\nNapster introduced technology that allowed users to download songs for free. The technology also allowed mixing and matching of songs so that users could create their own CDs. The same concept was then used by Apple to create iTune and the iPod, while Sony decided to simply extend its existing model to make room for this new technology, but trying to keep as-is the control of the IP.\nThe matrix shows that the game was about adding a level of freedom in the consumption of songs, rather than just extending technology.\n7.3 Strategic analysis - the matrix can be used to define where to direct future developments:\nTelcos are being threatened by VOIP, which allows near free communication anywhere around the world. Several options are available for them to react: bundle services, or offer new services for mobile, where VOIP is not a player today. Docomo is now offering payments through mobile phones, thus starting to compete with banks. The matrix can help figure out which players they should work with to make this strategy successful\n7.4 Positioning analysis - the matrix can help position a product on a market. A computer is a complex thing and I can decide to buy through an expert who will help me design the computer I need, or I can go to Dell to build online my own. The 2 market segments can co-exist today, but the matrix can help understand which market will survive in the long term\nCase studies\n8.1 Swissquote (a Swiss equivalent of eTrade)\nFrom the CEO prospective, the success of Swissquote is due to:\nEmpowerment: providing the right information and tools to customers to allow them to trade online\nMonitoring: performing statistical analysis to evaluate risk, as a tool for both the bank and the users\nE-wealth management: tools to help users optimize their investments\nOne challenge was and still is the education of customers. 2 types of classes are offered: first step (free), and paying classes on specific topics. This is a very costly undertaking, a risk taken to help the transformation\nThe other challenge is to provide the right tools, allowing to perform complex operations while remaining user friendly. This challenge still needs to be addressed today.\nLooking at the banking industry, there are 2 major trends that can be identified:\nCommunities of practice are taking over the education of consumers and improved interactions\nModels need to be improved to help provide more sophisticated tools\nThe matrix can help clarify these trends and challenges\n8.2 Largeur.com - citizen journalism\nAfter several experiments, Largeur.com has settled for a model where they produce high quality journalism but getting the content from freelancers and offering aggressive prices. Once the customer base was established, they looked into opening the platform to students and other members of the civil society (teachers, thought leaders but also unemployed people), which are representative of the audience they are addressing already.\nThe media industry is organized around 3 major poles:\nConvergence (synergy between traditional media and the Internet) - Financial Times, Wall Street Journal\nDivergence (break from the traditional model to go towards a crowdsourcing approach) - OhMyNews\nComplementarities (compromise between the other two) - TSR.ch\nThe matrix can help rationalize the various content production and content delivery tools (blogs, RSS, Web, SMS/MMS, and Newspapers) to better understand the media industry\n8.3 Cla-Val - pumps to regulate pressure\nThey have evolved around 4 major poles:\nCommoditization: they have accumulated over the years more than 100 standard products\nCustomization: their customers cannot get an end to end solution from just the standard products\nGeographical expansion: the experience gained in the implementation of custom solutions opens new geographical markets and allows rapid expansion\nCustomer innovation: customization has also introduced flexibility into the system, and combined with remote management capabilities has enabled co-innovation\nThe matrix clearly shows how this evolution was possible.\nConclusion\nDirect economy is the result of 5 major factors:\nIntroduction of the consumer into the value chain\nDeath of the old intermediaries, to leave room for new types of interactions\nEmpowerment of ordinary people to include them in the innovation process, which creates the issue of Intellectual Property and how to handle it\nEmergence of new business models that threaten the existing monopolies\nEmergence of new pricing models: donations (OhMyNews) or Bidding (EBay).\nIKEA, Easyjet, Dell, Nokia, L'Oreal, Procter&Gamble, Swissquote are examples of the transformations that can be implemented. Companies have to move towards hypergrowth to survive.\nWhat is interesting is that new sub-categories of products are being created in the process (song vs. album), that banks and credit cards were not setup to handle originally. Hel looks and The Satorialist are examples of what is happening in the fashion industry. Istockphoto, Innocentive or Marketocracy are example of consumer involvement in the value chain.\nIn conclusion, isn't it that the changes we are witnessing in the economy are similar to what happened with Direct Democracy in Switzerland?\nThe consumers have been empowered, and are we not slowly evolving towards a Direct Economy, completely changing the underlying principles of the Global Economy as we know it today?\nEpilogue\nWhile Switzerland introduced Direct Democracy, they are now lagging in their e-government implementation effort. The matrix can help understand what is happening and what needs to be done. It can help compare what is available today against what others in Europe\n", "index": [[1907, 1921], [3592, 3603], [3715, 3720], [5090, 5094], [5521, 5525], [5774, 5785], [5816, 5825], [5878, 5884], [6127, 6131], [6332, 6335], [9215, 9235], [10758, 10765], [10968, 10973], [10984, 10989], [10998, 11002], [11010, 11014], [15294, 15301], [15303, 15307], [15310, 15314], [15316, 15323], [15325, 15329], [15331, 15336], [15767, 15778], [15959, 15975], [15979, 15990], [16137, 16151], [16188, 16199], [16211, 16227], [16438, 16444]], "wikipedia_ids": [42719, 18831, 26748, 14751, 102490, 59126142, 5043734, 11921, 102490, 21306150, 72896, 21113, 856, 186266, 89847, 26989, 8586748, 130495, 14751, 180466, 102490, 21242, 12686562, 95816, 26748, 227630, 26748, 95816, 9239], "wikipedia_titles": ["Do it yourself", "Mathematics", "Switzerland", "IKEA", "Dell", "Open source", "Wikipedia", "Gambling", "Dell", "Random-access memory", "Knowledge management", "Napster", "Apple Inc.", "ITunes", "IPod", "Sony", "Bidding", "EBay", "IKEA", "EasyJet", "Dell", "Nokia", "InnoCentive", "Direct democracy", "Switzerland", "World economy", "Switzerland", "Direct democracy", "Europe"]}

Coach Richt\u2019s job security came up, though I have no idea why. For his part, AJ didn\u2019t know how big this was.\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m about to go wolf down a Chick-fil-A spicy chicken sandwich, of the sort the hardworking reporters present in the greater metropolitan Birmingham area cruelly were denied yesterday.\nGo \u2018Dawgs!\nTweet\n3 comments\n|\n0 recs \u00a0|\nDo you like this story?\nMore from Dawg Sports\nSB Nation Launches YouTube\u00a0Channel\nFeb 2012 by T Kyle King\n- 16 comments\nThursday Morning Dawg Bites: Suck It Up, You Bunch of Crybabies!\u00a0Edition\nFeb 2012 by T Kyle King\n- 41 comments\nArtificial Turf and SEC Expansion: Why It's Time for the Missouri Tigers to Get\u00a0Real\nFeb 2012 by T Kyle King\n- 67 comments\nTuesday Morning Dawg Bites: Bulldog Nation Brought Its Beads to Mardi Gras\u00a0Edition\nFeb 2012 by T Kyle King\n- 4 comments\nSEC Scheduling in the Expansion Era: How to Preserve Permanent Conference\u00a0Rivalries and Protect Perennial Non-Conference Rivalries\nFeb 2012 by T Kyle King\n- 8 comments\nMonday Morning Dawg Bites Salutes Greg McGarity and Gives Auburn's Coaching Move Two Thumbs\u00a0Up!\nFeb 2012 by T Kyle King\n- 37 comments\nAround SB Nation\n2.11.12 College Hoops Saturday Open\u00a0Thread\nFeb 2012 from Anonymous Eagle\n- 16 comments\n2012 NFL Draft: Michael Floyd Expected Surprise At The\u00a0Combine\nFeb 2012 from Turf Show Times\n- 17 comments\nRPI WATCH:\u00a02/11/12\nFeb 2012 from Bring On The Cats\n- 0 comments\nRPI WATCH:\u00a02/13/12\nFeb 2012 from Bring On The Cats\n- 3 comments\nCincinnati Bengals Should Look To The New Orleans Saints During Free\u00a0Agency\nFeb 2012 from Cincy Jungle\n- 60 comments\nRead More: mark richt, sec media days, sec, southeastern conference, team speed kills, spencer hall, orson swindle, chick-fil-a, spicy chicken sandwich, sec media days 2010, A.J.

Engineering students are generally interested in innovation and the creation of new products or ideas. They have been exposed to the sciences and like learning about the scientific disciplines. Logic is a key element for engineering students, as they must reason through problems. Besides the intrinsic rewards of an engineering degree, students may pursue it for the lucrative salaries that come with an engineering career.\nThere are different engineering disciplines and all of the top five engineering schools offer programs within the disciplines. These disciplines include:\nArchitecture - designing structures/buildings\nChemical - converting raw materials to usable compounds\nCivil - designing infrastructure like roads and bridges\nComputer - creating all aspects of computers\nElectrical - manipulating electricity and magnetism to create devices\nIndustrial - enhance industrial processes\nGeotechnical - improve processes or machines related to natural resources like oil and wood\nMechanical - create mechanical systems such as vehicles or engines\nHere are the top five Bachelor's degree engineering schools:\n1. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - This school is located in Cambridge, MA, which is also home to the prestigious Harvard University. MIT has an enrollment of 4,232 undergraduates and a total of 10,384 students and is within minutes of Boston. The tuition cost for the university is $39,212 but financial aid is available to cover these costs.\n2. Stanford University - Stanford University is located right by Palo Alto, California, a high technology city that is home to many prominent companies like Facebook, Hewlett-Packard, and Tesla Motors. Stanford has 6,878 undergraduates and a total enrollment of 15,319 students. Tuition at Stanford University costs $39,201 but the school has a no loans policy where students whose families earn less than $100,000 do not have to pay tuition, while those whose families earn less than $60,000 do not have to pay for room and board or dining plans as well.\n3. University of California, Berkeley - The University of California, Berkeley is one of the most prominent public universities in the nation. It is located in Berkeley, CA, a forward-thinking city that was voted the third most liberal city in the United States and is home to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The university has 25,530 undergraduates and 35,843 total students. In-state tuition is $10,868 while out-of-state students are billed $33,747.\n4. California Institute of Technology - The California Institute of Technology, known as Caltech, is situated in Pasadena, CA, about 11 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Caltech has a smaller student body than the other universities on this list, with 967 undergraduates and 2,130 total students. \u00a0Annual tuition at Caltech is $36,282, but this is offset by the fact that Caltech alumni have the highest median starting salary among all universities, according to Payscale.\n5. Georgia Institute of Technology - This is also one of the most prestigious public schools in the country and is usually called Georgia Tech. The campus is located in midtown Atlanta, GA\n", "index": [[2895, 2932], [2934, 2937], [2967, 2976], [2978, 2980], [3020, 3038], [3040, 3043], [3142, 3148], [3253, 3272], [3275, 3294], [3315, 3324], [3326, 3336], [3407, 3415], [3417, 3432], [3438, 3450], [3452, 3460], [3540, 3559], [3809, 3843], [3850, 3874], [3876, 3884], [3966, 3974], [3976, 3978], [4054, 4067], [4087, 4124], [4273, 4307], [4314, 4348], [4359, 4366], [4383, 4391], [4393, 4395], [4434, 4445], [4447, 4454], [4593, 4600], [4649, 4656], [4741, 4749], [4754, 4785], [4881, 4893], [4920, 4935], [4937, 4939]], "wikipedia_ids": [18879, 18879, 5685, 1645518, 18426501, 18879, 24437894, 26977, 26977, 53445, 5407, 7529378, 21347024, 5533631, 26977, 26977, 31922, 31921, 4860, 4860, 5407, 3434750, 62214, 5786, 5786, 5786, 92408, 5407, 18110, 5786, 5786, 5786, 7805559, 28486339, 28486339, 768632, 48830], "wikipedia_titles": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Massachusetts", "Harvard University", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Boston", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "Palo Alto, California", "California", "Facebook", "Hewlett-Packard", "Tesla, Inc.", "Stanford University", "Stanford University", "University of California, Berkeley", "University of California", "Berkeley, California", "Berkeley, California", "California", "United States", "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "Pasadena, California", "California", "Los Angeles", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "California Institute of Technology", "PayScale", "Georgia Tech", "Georgia Tech", "Midtown Atlanta", "Georgia (U.S. state)"]}

But previous attention had been directed at the financial elements of his ministry at Atlanta\u2019s New Birth Missionary Baptist Church.\nEddie Long is a teacher of prosperity theology, a perverse distortion of the gospel that transforms the message of Christ into a message of secular salvation through wealth and prosperity. Scholars of the movement have studied why it is that poor, disadvantaged, and disenfranchised people seem so drawn to a false gospel that leaves them poor but makes their preachers wealthy. They seem to find encouragement and hope, even a source of pride, in a pastor who preaches prosperity and lives in ostentatious wealth, even as they contribute their own meager funds.\nThe Bible is clear in warning against false prophets who preach false gospels and those who would use spiritual authority for their own wealth. The world is scandalized by the false promises of prosperity, and believers in Christ should be just as scandalized about this false promise. But Christians should be far more concerned about the eternal consequences of prosperity theology \u2014 its false promise of salvation through financial abundance, of health and wealth through the exercise of \u201cseed faith.\u201d Missing from the prosperity gospel is the message of salvation through faith in Christ alone \u2014 a salvation that makes every believer unspeakably wealthy in the grace of Christ but does not promise earthly riches or unblemished physical health.\nWriting in the \u201cHouses of Worship\u201d column in today\u2019s edition of The Wall Street Journal, DeForest B. [\"Buster\"] Soaries, Jr., pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens in Somerset, New Jersey, writes of the scandal of the prosperity gospel and its popularity among African American churches:\nThe prosperity gospel\u2014the idea that God guarantees truly faithful\nbelievers physical health and financial wealth\u2014is not new. But cable and\nsatellite television broadcasting have turned prosperity preachers into\ncelebrities that have followings similar to musicians and movie stars.\nA movement and a theology that once seemed like an aberration among\nblack churches now appears to be mainstream.\nHe writes further:\nTeaching that desire for more material possessions is a sign of one\u2019s\nreligious piety is simply offering a justification for crass\nconsumerism. Prosperity theology elevates greed to a virtue instead of\nleaving it as one of the seven deadly sins.\nOf course, it is much easier for clergy to preach this gospel when they\nare living proof that the \u201csystem\u201d works. Hence the celebrity-like\nlifestyles of so many religious leaders. The fact that the people most\nlikely to do well in the prosperity gospel movement are the people at\nthe top suggests that it is all an ecclesiastical pyramid scheme.\nSoaries seems mostly concerned in this article about the false promises of wealth and the economic effects of these teachings on African Americans. All Christians should share his outrage and know that prosperity theology is found among all races and ethnicities. The television screens are filled with their messages and heresies.\nBut the central problem with prosperity theology is that is is a false gospel. The prosperity preachers do not promise too much. They promise all the wrong things.\nOf course, The Wall Street Journal is an interesting place to find an article on prosperity theology. The editors of that famous newspaper know what leads to financial wealth \u2014 that is their business \u2014 and they know that prosperity theology leads into deeper poverty. It\u2019s only those at the top who drive the expensive cars and ride in private jets.\nDeForest B.

Given the facts of this case and the significance of the nation\u2019s most populous state, the Supreme Court is almost certain to take the case. This sets the stage for the courts to make some determinative statement on same-sex marriage within the next several months \u2014 a decision that will go a long way toward setting the direction of the larger culture.\n\u2022 Keep Reading \u2192\nBooks by R.

Half of the meeting was devoted to a \u2018visioning\u2019 exercise where the group responded to the question, \u201cit\u2019s Dec. 2019 and the media asks you, \u2018what has this group accomplished in sustainable transportation in the last ten years?\u2019\u201d\nSmall groups brainstormed and then the larger group voted for their favorites among the long list of \u2018accomplishments\u2019. Top vote getters are:\nWe adopted \u2018complete streets\u2019 legislation and incorporate it in every road project\nWe\u2019ve completed the Towpath Trail and the Cleveland neighborhood connectors\nWe have predictable transit funding from the federal government\nWe increased \u2018mode shift\u2019 \u2013 more transit riders and transportation cyclists\n\u201cThe next meeting we\u2019ll talk about metrics,\u201d said Mike Neundorfer, president of Neundorfer Particulate Knowledge and co-convener of the group. \u201cWe should link with the Metrics group that came out of the 2019 summit. And among us we should divide into smaller groups and work on developing metrics.\u201d\nProjects updates followed the visioning session. They are:\nImproving the performance of Euclid Corridor as a Complete Street\nKevin Schmotzer at the city\u2019s Department of Economic Development, offered that some of the recent changes to the timing of traffic lights on Euclid Corridor are due to construction. \u201cMany have come from east-west route changes and from RTA drivers, but if you have specific intersections of concern, flag them.\u201d\nBrad Chase at GreenCityBlueLake Institute and chair of RTA Citizens\u2019 Advisory Board, said the larger concern is keeping the line of communication open between the city, RTA and other stakeholders to help achieve the promised 20 minute travel time from Public Square to East Cleveland.\n\u201cHow do we have better communications between groups in corridor, and how do we define a Complete Street corridor?\u201d Chase said. \u201cThis is supposed to be a bus, pedestrian and bike priority corridor. If we want to get this (complete streets) working around the city, we have to get it right here first.\u201d\nAction item: Chase and John Mitterholzer, program officer at Gund Foundation and a 2019 Transportation group co-convener, will work on a meeting with the stakeholders along the corridor with the goal of establishing a \u201cbetter communication protocol on changes\u201d that have lengthened the 20 minute trip time for the HealthLine bus-rapid transit line.\n3-C passenger rail\nLegislators need to hear the urgency from supporters of the 3-C, said Devan Willemsen, Director of Air & Land Use Special Projects at the Ohio Environmental Council. Ohio has $400 million promised from the federal government for high speed rail, but it has not been committed by the state. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into a bit of a governor\u2019s race issue. Some people are calling multi-modalism a passing fad. The controlling board for 3-C need to let legislators, specifically Bill Harris, know to get this going.\u201d\nMitterholzer added that many are not aware that the federally designated high-speed rail corridors will continue to receive funding, up to $1 billion over next few years. \u201cIf we turn down this money, we\u2019re done with rail in this state for the next decade. We\u2019re the only state considering turning down the federal money.\u201d\nAction item: Willemsen said supporters of the 3-C can let their legislators know how they feel using this web site http://www.linkingohio.com/\nFederal funding for multi-modal projects\nTransportation legislation has been introduced in the Senate, after the House passed its version. Supporters of multimodal and active transportation can sign up for Rails-to-Trails Conservancy email alerts, said RTC Ohio director Rhonda Border-Boose. \u201cTalk about predictable, federal funding \u2013 this is it,\u201d she said.\nAction item: \u201cWe need senate support \u2013 specifically Sen. Voinovich,\" Border-Boose said. 'We would like a \u2018show Congress\u2019 event, to tour Voinovich around where the alternative transportation dollars are being spent. Right now we need letters to legislators.\"\nMulti-purpose path on the Innerbelt Bridge\nGovernor Strickland said he\u2019d like ODOT to look again at the feasibility of a bike and pedestrian path on the new Innerbelt Bridge. \u201cHe has a couple of important caveats, on cost and safety that we plan to address,\u201d said ClevelandBikes volunteer Kevin Cronin. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the step the governor took, and Senator Brown\u2019s letter. It\u2019s a testament to the individuals who sent letters to local and federal leaders. We\u2019re not out of woods yet, but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d\nThe group rounded out the meeting discussing new roles to sharpen implementation. A coordinator that works with the city, a liaison to other 2019 groups, a strategic plan coordinator, and an executive committee for the group were some of the positions identified for further discussion.\nIn its wants and needs category, the group identified the following:\nCan we convince the city that our priorities are their priorities?\nWhat\u2019s our role from 2019?\nIdentifying right minority reps.\nSufficient focus.\nSubcommittee structure.\nID short term goals to expand the scope of the group.\nThink bigger for action items \u2013 to gain traction, go for something substantial.\nKeep track of accomplishments done (quantify and capture).\nA complete streets group\nFocus, don\u2019t want to get spread too thin.\nBuy in from local politicians.\nClearer vision of responsibilities, what power do we have to make the changes?\nBe clear communicating to the public.\nNeed more attention to what is our authority and use our networks to get more attention to our projects.\nAnd how drive issue home through channels that we know.\n\u2039 2019 Transportation group October 2010 meeting minutes\nup\nComparison measurements and metrics \u203a\nThis site is inspired by the memory of Richard Shatten, a former board member of EcoCity Cleveland, who pushed Northeast Ohio to think strategically about regionalism and sustainability.\nA service of the GreenCityBlueLake Institute at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.\nOperating support provided by The George Gund Foundation.\nThe GreenCityBlueLake name and logo are registered service marks of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History\n", "index": [[1885, 1894], [2032, 2041], [5354, 5357], [5599, 5602], [5682, 5695], [5699, 5713], [6030, 6035], [6078, 6093], [6331, 6341], [6850, 6861], [7448, 7454], [7466, 7471], [7822, 7830], [8021, 8031], [8047, 8051], [8126, 8142], [8334, 8339], [9014, 9016], [9232, 9237], [9792, 9806], [9920, 9955], [9991, 10013], [10087, 10122]], "wikipedia_ids": [129084, 129084, 755427, 755427, 8654977, 129084, 384969, 18753923, 19920177, 1915835, 24909346, 13590, 31756, 8433426, 5585716, 21581530, 38902, 364578, 8013981, 521854, 722310, 18753923, 722310], "wikipedia_titles": ["East Cleveland, Ohio", "East Cleveland, Ohio", "Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority", "Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority", "Public Square", "East Cleveland, Ohio", "Chase Bank", "The George Gund Foundation", "HealthLine", "Bill Harris (Ohio politician)", "United States Senate", "House", "United States Congress", "Fauquier-Strickland", "Ohio Department of Transportation", "Innerbelt Bridge", "Brown", "Identity document", "Focus (German magazine)", "Northeast Ohio", "Cleveland Museum of Natural History", "The George Gund Foundation", "Cleveland Museum of Natural History"]}

The debate went for the full 30 minutes, and was charitable for the most part, except one well-known agitator in the Melbourne Diocese in Australia claiming the motion and its motives were \u201cdisingenuous\u201d \u2013 that was a low point. The vote by voices wasn\u2019t able to decide whether the motion had passed or been defeated, so someone asked for a count of the house. It turns out there was just a quorum of people \u2013 in Melbourne Diocese only a third of Synod (284 people, I think) is required to be present for a quorum \u2013 there were 325 Synod members present who voted on the motion (either for or against). On a count of hands 175 people were \u201cagainst\u201d, 150 people \u201cfor\u201d. The motion was lost by 25 people. It was a close vote!\nThe saddest aspects to the vote are twofold: i. a decent number of Synod members had little idea of what the motion was really about (that is, they were confused by the whole thing and they aren\u2019t aware that ACNA-affiliated parishes are being dragged through the courts to acquire their properties), even after some careful, but informative speeches from the mover and seconder of the motion; and, ii., to lose the motion by 25 people is disappointing, given that there were a number of people absent from Synod who would have voted in favour of the motion if they were there \u2013 this is one of those \u201cluck of the draw\u201d situations, where you don\u2019t know the exact timing of the hearing of the motion.\nPosted in Anglican Church in North America\n13 Responses to \u201cDiocese of Melbourne motion supporting ACNA defeated\u201d\n1\nstuck in Toronto says:\nOctober 31, 2009 at 11:25 am\nIf all the facts are true this is a perfect argument for the \u201cdisingenuous\u201d nature of currect Synod operations.\nI submit that until we adopt a procedure whereby all motions must be passed unanimously, or tabled for further action we leave a thin edge for the wedge.\nI hope arguments follow, but please do not forget the \u201cFactor of Faith\u201d.\n2\nstuck in Toronto says:\nNovember 2, 2009 at 9:35 am\nI am surprised and disappointed there is no dialogue on this subject.\nAny reasons?\n3\nIrena says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 12:11 am\n#2: Usually we are silenced by discouraging news.\nHowever, I don\u2019t think we have need to be discouraged:\ndemocratic votes are not usually related to the Lord\u2019s favour.\nWe know this fact well in New Westminster.\n4\nJason says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 12:43 am\nI hear that Australia\u2019s Sydney Diocese passed their ACNA motion! That\u2019s great news.\n5\nstuck in Toronto says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 10:28 am\nIrena I take it from your statement \u2013 \u201cdemocratic votes are not usually related to the Lord\u2019s favour\u201d that you agree with my #1\n6\nGerry O'Brien says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 11:44 am\nStuck:\nIf we need 100% in favor or against votes, doesn\u2019t this lead to what is called dictatorship?\nOnly a dictatorial government can achieve unanimous agreement ALL of the time.\nIrena:\nmethinks you to be more right than wrong on the idea that democratic votes usually go against the Lord\u2019s favor.\nSeems that has always been the case ~~~~ unless all the voters or at least the majority of the voters are \u201cChristians\u201d, then it goes to the Lord\u2019s favor of course.\nUnfortunately todays society thinks themselves in North America to be Christian but have been so far led away from the truth that they are not.\nHow unfortunate and sad.\n7\nIrena says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 12:22 pm\nStuck in Toronto #5: Not necessarily.\nEven a unanimous vote does not guarantee the Lord\u2019s favour.\nAdam and Eve were unanimous!\nHaving said that, I will agree that, in a group of Christians, unanimity is a beautiful thing.\n8\nstuck in Toronto says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 5:00 pm\n# 6 Gerry, Dictatorship and Monarchist Government is always unanimous \u201call the time\u201d.\nWere the requirment for unanimity in Synod operations does not garantee \u201call the time\u201d when a motion does not pass it is tabled.\nThe procedure or follow up on a tabled motion is varied.\nMy personal choice is to put it off until the next synod.\nThis leaves time for healthy discussion, debate, and prayer.\nIf the next Synod (second reading) fails to reach unanimous agreement than the Bishop in Charge would strike a committee of pro and con persons based on the same percentage as the second vote.\nThes folks would be tasked (like a jury) to determine unanimous consent.\nAny and all arguments can be submitted to said committee during the interim.\nThe result -unanimous or hung, is presented during third Synod (reading) if vote is not unanimous than the Motion is tossed.\n9\nstuck in Toronto says:\nNovember 3, 2009 at 5:22 pm\nIrena\n\u201cAdam and Eve were unanimous!\u201d;\nwere they?\nwasn\u2019t there a third person missing?\nI would welcome any biblical example of unaniminity failing God\u2019s will.\nJesus said \u201cwhere two or three are gathered together OF THE SAME ACCORD (unanimity) there I will be in the midst.\nThe Church has lost a vital component in it\u2019s two-thousand year journey.\nI call it the factor of faith.\nWe acknowledge faith as a gift but fail to use it.\nSo what happens to something when it doesn\u2019t get used?\n10\nIrena says:\nNovember 4, 2009 at 1:40 am\n#9 Stuck:\nIs this the verse you\u2019re referring to?\n\u201cFor where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.\u201d Matthew 10:20\n\u2018In my name\u2019 is missing in your verse so I\u2019m not sure.\nThe context of this particular verse has to do with ejecting an unrepentant brother out of the church.\nAnd of course, the presence of the Lord Jesus would give the necessary authority for such an action.\n11\nstuck in Toronto says:\nNovember 4, 2009 at 10:54 am\nIrena; I have defended the premise of \u201csame Accord\u201d as a source of Spiritual Power.\nI believe that \u201cin my name\u201d\nmeans \u201cof the same accord\u201d.\nThe fact that I could not find the quote I used in my #9 was a shock to me as I have used it so often.\nI apologize for the confusing mis-quote. I don\u2019t agree with your contextual assessment.\nMatt.18: 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\n20..For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\nPhilippians 2:2\nFulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.\nActs 1:14\nThese all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.\nActs 2:1\nAnd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.\n12\nIrena says:\nNovember 6, 2009 at 12:17 pm\n#11 Stuck:\nBeing of one accord and \u201cin my name\u201d are certainly tightly related, as the verses in your previous post show.\nIf we are considering a matter together in Jesus\u2019 name\u2013that is, if we really do stand under his authority and in his love, as I think the phrase suggests\u2013we will be of like mind because we\u2019ll be sharing in the mind of Christ (Phil. 2, v.5).\nWhen the glory and honour of the Lord Jesus are at stake, this kind of accord will look like unanimity.\nAnd I think this is how ACNA has so wonderfully been founded among groups so varying in detail.\nWe all knew we couldn\u2019t stay with the National Churches because the very Lordship of Christ was being questioned in these churches.\nOn the subject of non-essentials (where the Bible is not totally clear on a subject, for example), the accord will look more like mutual submission in which we leave our pet issues aside for the sake of unity. Mutual submission may not look at all like agreement or unanimity, but it will glorify the Lord Jesus\n", "index": [[194, 212], [532, 541], [1323, 1327], [2693, 2708], [2765, 2774], [2805, 2809], [3354, 3358], [3475, 3485], [3508, 3512], [3582, 3595], [3602, 3611], [3753, 3760], [3842, 3854], [3922, 3932], [4030, 4042], [4489, 4495], [4499, 4505], [4938, 4950], [5077, 5080], [5089, 5094], [5207, 5213], [5790, 5795], [5950, 5956], [6714, 6738], [6792, 6801], [7070, 7075], [7245, 7251], [7306, 7311], [7396, 7400], [7553, 7559], [7644, 7649], [7906, 7911]], "wikipedia_ids": [3550644, 4689264, 13487228, 928231, 4689264, 13487228, 69304, 18337522, 69304, 21139, 18337522, 64646, 11473533, 18337522, 9033, 4092, 921126, 11473533, 5042765, 1095706, 6325, 1095706, 364459, 73513, 45971, 1095706, 1095706, 1095706, 13487228, 1095706, 3390, 1095706], "wikipedia_titles": ["Diocese of Niagara", "Australia", "Anglican Church in North America", "Anglican Diocese of New Westminster", "Australia", "Anglican Church in North America", "Lord", "Christians", "Lord", "North America", "Christians", "Toronto", "Adam and Eve", "Christians", "Dictatorship", "Bishop", "Charge (heraldry)", "Adam and Eve", "God", "Jesus", "Church (building)", "Jesus", "Honda Accord", "Mary, mother of Jesus", "Pentecost", "Jesus", "Jesus", "Jesus", "Anglican Church in North America", "Jesus", "Bible", "Jesus"]}

OK, so it isn\u2019t that easy, but it\u2019s not difficult, either.\nDecember 26, 2008\n| by Rebecca Day\nIt wasn\u2019t too long ago when we were thrilled with the prospect of jamming thousands of tunes onto a PC or iPod. Many of us weren\u2019t particularly discriminating about the quality of the sound, though, and now that tinny audio is grating on our ears. We\u2019d like more elegant solutions.\nContent is everywhere, after all. Securing high-quality content just takes a little more effort\u2014and investment\u2014but the payoff is worth it if you have a passion for music and movies.\nAudiophiles came up with their own solutions for ripping CDs using lossless codecs. On the music store side, Apple iTunes Plus came along with higher-res files that double the bit rate for less-compressed audio. And MusicGiants became the go-to download service for high-quality rights-protected WMA files with its lossless uncompressed music file library.\nEarlier this year, MusicGiants launched a sister platform called VideoGiants, which delivers movies, concerts and music videos in lossless WMV ranging from 480p to 1080p resolution using bit rates of up to 45 mbps. Currently the site offers five movie collections ranging from $149 for 10 Star Trek films to $1,125 for the eclectic Movie Lovers\u2019 Collection of 75 movies. Individual purchase options are on the docket.\nIf typing in a URL, logging into a download site, and plugging in a credit card number sounds like more than you care to take on when settling back in your theater recliner, take note: Aspen Media Products and HDGiants\u2014the new combined brand of VideoGiants and MusicGiants\u2014teamed up to create the HD MediaStore application, which integrates with electronics connected to Microsoft Vista\u2019s Media Center Edition.\nThe application enables Media Center owners to legally buy and download high-quality movies and music directly to an entertainment system via remote control. Downloaded music and videos can be distributed from the server\u2019s hard drive throughout the house via Media Center extenders.\nOver the next few months, other MusicGiants partners will incorporate HD MediaStore into their interfaces. Look for Crestron, Olive, Niveus, QSonix, Russound, Inteset and others to include the application as well.\nHDGiants content partners include Paramount, Sony BMG, EMI, Fantasy, HDNet, Image Entertainment, Universal Music Group, Warner Music, Linn Records, Telarc and others. At press time, HDGiants was gearing up to announce two additional studio partners.\nDownloadable content is no longer a compromise. With hi-res music and video downloads at our fingertips, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to justify those 5-inch discs.\nArticle Topics\nAV Components \u00b7\nInfo & Answers \u00b7\nMedia Server \u00b7\nMovies \u00b7\nWeb Services \u00b7\nView all topics\nWhat's Related\nWhy Internet Downloads Will Save the Planet\nXBMC Boosts Media Center with Babylon Update\nIs High-Def Apple TV Coming Soon?\nNetflix, Starz Team for More Streamed Content\nApple to Deliver iTunes Movies on DVD Release Dates\nVUDU Adds 1080p HDX\nMovie Downloads Coming to TiVo through Amazon\n1\u00a02\u00a03\u00a0>\u00a0\u00a0Last \u00bb\nPopular Tags\nHome Theater 119\nAudio 68\nSpeakers 55\nDeals 47\nHome Control 47\n3D 46\niPad 38\niPhone 31\nHome Automation 28\niPod 27\nBlu-ray 25\nStreaming Media 25\nReview 15\nEnergy Management 15\nGaming 13\nRemote Control 12\nNetflix 11\nMedia Server 10\nWi-Fi 10\nLighting Control 10\nSocial Bookmark\nless\nDigg\ndel.ico.us\nTechnorati\nGoogle\nMy Yahoo!\nNewsvine\nBlinkList\nReddit\nBlogmarks\nFurl\nma.gnolia\nWindowsLive\nTailrank\nMister Wong\nNetscape\nStumble Upon\nCommenting is not available in this weblog entry.\nGet Electronic House Email Newsletters\nNews\nCool Homes\nBlogs\nPhoto Galleries\nHot Deal: Mitsubishi 73-inch WD-73C11 1080p 3D DLP HDTV: $999.99\nDell has a hot deal on Mitsubishi\u2019s 3D DLP, knocking 52 percent off the list price.\nIndiana Jones Box Coming to Blu-ray This Fall\nSmarthome Debuts Security Camera for DIYers\nParks: 60 Percent Will Have Networked Energy Management by 2022\nApp Alert: Craftsman Assurelink Garage Opener\nView more recent posts\nLook Inside Oscar Nominee George Clooney\u2019s Home Theater\n\u201cDescendants\u201d star George Clooney\n", "index": [[147, 157], [2611, 2615], [3265, 3268], [3465, 3468], [3615, 3624], [4115, 4130], [4554, 4562], [4564, 4569], [4686, 4695], [4697, 4705], [4707, 4710], [4712, 4719], [4721, 4726], [4728, 4747], [4749, 4770], [4772, 4784], [4786, 4798], [4800, 4806], [6125, 6129], [6148, 6158], [6507, 6521]], "wikipedia_ids": [48442, 89847, 34082, 225169, 17157886, 2289648, 62074849, 22479, 22918, 895671, 140624, 23534170, 1326295, 54145191, 209901, 454544, 377492, 2484493, 102490, 48442, 158889], "wikipedia_titles": ["Mitsubishi Group", "IPod", "Windows Media Audio", "Windows Media Video", "Star Trek", "Windows Vista", "Crestron Electronics", "Olive", "Paramount Pictures", "Sony BMG", "EMI", "Fantasy", "AXS TV", "RLJE Films", "Universal Music Group", "Warner Music Group", "Linn Records", "Telarc International Corporation", "Dell", "Mitsubishi Group", "George Clooney"]}

It\u2019s disappointing and unfortunate that we have to deal with this in the middle of the season. \u201cIt is what it is, so right now as a team we have to focus on the things we can control, and we have a very challenging game here against a very talented opponent in Florida. We have to get ready to play the game.\u201dGrant suspended Green, Releford and Steele indefinitely just before Saturday\u2019s loss at LSU for violating team rules, sending them packing for Tuscaloosa before tipoff.That was also the second game of Mitchell\u2019s suspension.The disciplinary actions left the Tide (16-8, 5-5 Southeastern Conference) without players responsible for 69 percent of its scoring, 57 percent of rebounding and 54 percent of assists at a time when the stakes are ratcheted up. Green and Mitchell are the team\u2019s top scorers and rebounders, while Releford leads Alabama in assists and Steele is a key role player.Grant said his decision to hold the players out had much to do with the long-term quality of the program and trying to build \u201cthe values and standards that you want your team to represent.\u201d He hasn\u2019t elaborated on the reasons for the suspensions.Grant declined to say if the violations of Mitchell and Green were more serious, but reiterated that their suspension remained indefinite.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that, that\u2019s just the way it is right now,\u201d he said.This is the third time Grant has suspended Green, a first-team All-SEC player, during his three seasons, including a three-game string early last season and one game at the end of 2009-10.Grant didn\u2019t rule it out when asked if he had a \u201cthree-strike\u201d policy that might keep Green from returning.\u201cI\u2019ll make some decisions on that later,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now my focus is on getting prepared for Florida.\u201dAlabama had risen to No. 12 in the rankings in December and won three straight before the LSU game.The bold decision on the suspensions was no surprise to Gators coach Billy Donovan, who was Grant\u2019s boss for a dozen years at Marshall and Florida.\u201cI know Anthony Grant about as well as anybody, and I think that he has got incredible integrity and character and knows exactly the way he wants his program run and what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Donovan said.The Tide\u2019s eight remaining players \u2014 half of them freshmen \u2014 managed to come fairly close before losing 67-58 to LSU, with freshman Rodney Cooper scoring 28 points. Alabama had beaten Auburn by 18 points without Mitchell.Now comes a much bigger challenge, even with Releford and Steele.The Gators (19-6, 7-3) opened last March with a 78-51 rout of a Tide team that still had aspirations of winning an SEC title and making the NCAA field.Florida is also short-handed, but because of injuries. The Gators won\u2019t have their top subs, forward Will Yeguete (concussion) and guard Mike Rosario (bruised hip), for the game, Donovan\n", "index": [[2425, 2433], [2795, 2805], [2911, 2918], [2940, 2954], [2959, 2972], [3013, 3026], [3051, 3066], [3161, 3176], [3486, 3491], [3788, 3795], [3836, 3841], [3852, 3857], [3859, 3867], [3923, 3926], [3978, 3988], [4036, 4044], [4108, 4131], [4287, 4292], [4297, 4305], [4355, 4363], [4421, 4426], [4667, 4672], [4710, 4718], [4723, 4728], [4906, 4911], [4926, 4931], [4950, 4953], [5071, 5076], [5157, 5162], [5276, 5283], [5375, 5378], [5453, 5466], [5476, 5481], [5510, 5518], [5523, 5530], [5539, 5552], [5721, 5728], [5847, 5850], [5918, 5924], [5946, 5954], [6000, 6008], [6135, 6138], [6160, 6164], [6171, 6178], [6350, 6357]], "wikipedia_ids": [30812226, 57690, 18933066, 29516337, 30957146, 17125894, 30812226, 507399, 17125894, 18933066, 17125894, 29516337, 30812226, 5978520, 105167, 30957146, 79371, 29516337, 30957146, 30812226, 17125894, 17125894, 30957146, 29516337, 17125894, 29516337, 79371, 17125894, 29516337, 18933066, 5978520, 1443634, 17125894, 560365, 18933066, 17125894, 1443634, 5978520, 2846320, 30957146, 30812226, 79371, 507399, 18933066, 1443634], "wikipedia_titles": ["Trevor Releford", "Montgomery, Alabama", "Florida", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Anthony Grant", "Trevor Releford", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Anthony Grant", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Trevor Releford", "LSU Tigers football", "Tuscaloosa, Alabama", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Southeastern Conference", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Anthony Grant", "Anthony Grant", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "JaMychal Green", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Southeastern Conference", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Florida", "LSU Tigers football", "Billy Donovan", "Anthony Grant", "Marshall University", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "Billy Donovan", "LSU Tigers football", "Auburn Tigers football", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Southeastern Conference", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Florida", "Billy Donovan"]}

A month ago, Noriel Roubini framed the question smartly:In principle, the US recession could end up being shaped like a V, U, W, or L. Which of these four scenarios is most likely? The current consensus is that the recession will be V-shaped \u2013 short and shallow \u2013 and thus similar to the US recessions in 1990-91 and 2001, which lasted eight months each. Most analysts forecast that GDP will contract in the first half of 2008 and recover in the second half of the year. I expect a longer and deeper U-shaped recession, lasting at least 12 months and possibly as long as 18 months \u2013 one of the most severe US recessions in decades \u2013 because today\u2019s macroeconomic and financial conditions are far worse. Now on the spectrum of macroeconomic analysis, growth sits on the long-term end of the spectrum, whereas recession-watching is on the short-term end. This is my way of saying, growthology.org really shouldn\u2019t be commenting on the recession stuff \u2026 too small ball. So here\u2019s my justification:\nI\u2019ve published on this topic recently. My little model - the employment recession indicator \u2013 says the recession probability is in the 50% range. It will go higher (and I\u2019ll believe the recession has spread from financial markets to the real economy) once initial jobless claims rise above 400,000 consistently and unemployment goes to 6.0%. That may happen soon, and when it does, count me among the bears. But UI claims remain too low for a recession, and they tend to be early warning signals.\nThe specter of the Great Depression haunts any public conversation about economics, which includes this blog. And lest we forget, momentous shifts in popular and professional thinking occurred during the 1930s. In particular, the breakthrough work of our patron saint (Joseph Schumpeter) was notoriously overshadowed by the breakthrough work of JM Keynes.\nI dislike historical parallels such as \u201cThis recession has signs of becoming another great depression\u201d because (here\u2019s a Kane mantra) Growth Trumps All Historical Parallels.\nNo, America is not analogous to a new Roman Empire. No, the housing meltdown is not akin to 1929\u2019s great crash. Technological dynamism makes modernity so different from previous eras that no parallel really works. To clarify the larger posturing, ask yourself this: what is more important to contemporary affairs: hegemony, terrorism, or technology? Answer: technology. What\u2019s a bigger deal in the sweep of history: asset bubbles or technology? Answer: technology. Point being, I doubt the upcoming political debate of 2008 - which will focus on short-term economics and the War on Terror - will address the most important issue of technology acceleration and its implications. Remember when the NASDAQ crashed and the media said, \u201cThe New Economy Was an Illusion.\u201d They were wrong. The Internet\u2019s still here, folks, bigger than ever. The bottom line is that changes wrought by technology are VERY real, with both good and bad consequences. It is the topic that no grand strategist, or politician, or pundit should be allowed to ignore. Now, Roubini might agree with me on all that. But I was still skeptical about the recession ever being called, until this morning's employment report. My best guess remains that it won\u2019t be V or U or L or W shaped. I\u2019m looking for letters on my keyboard to represent my prediction. Ah, here it is: 0 (as in null set) I think aggressive Fed action on interest rates will be very effective in the short term (albeit inflationary). I doubt housing assets have declined enough to shake the lifecycle consumption smoothing habits of Americans, meaning GDP and the real economy will stagnate but not recess. I do worry about oil prices, but anticipate/hope/pray for that commodity speculation to pop. And ultimately, I think innovative entrepreneurship and consequently potential GDP are accelerating. My worst case scenario has a deep U-shaped recession that masks productivity growth for a year or two, followed by a booming catch-up to potential GDP in 2010-12 \u2026 plus lots of inflation.\nHat tip: RealClearMarkets\nPosted by Tim\nKane at 06:57 PM in Economic Growth, U.S. economy\n| Permalink\nTrackBack\nTrackBack URL for this entry:http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00e552120087883300e552eef0d48833\nListed below are links to weblogs that reference Is the Recession U shaped?:\nComments\nYes things seem bad statistically but like my dad always said, it only takes one person's will to get a job and one person is not a statistic.\nLots of 100K jobs -\nhttp://www.realmatch.com\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.6figurejobs.com\nSee!\nPosted by:\nSusan Kennedy |\nJune 07, 2008 at 11:12 AM\nTim: As I wrote on my blog, Truth on the Market, I think Tyler is pretty far off base with this one.

He is the son of Kingsley Jones, a former Wales captain and nowadays Director of Rugby at Sale, and his grandfather is Phil Kingsley Jones who has coached, managed and been a mentor to former All Blacks star Jonah Lomu.\nHighlights for Rhys include making his Premiership debut for Sale Sharks, playing at full-back in 2007 against Gloucester, and also playing for Wales U19s in their 2006 'Grand Slam' winning side.\nA rugby hero is Neil Jenkins, who is described as, \"a great role model\", and one Rhys has been fortunate to work with at various Welsh age group levels. Whilst on loan from Sale in February, 2008, Rhys also made a debut for Cardiff Blues against Munster.\nArriving in Cornwall, Rhys looked forward to the challenges ahead, him excited and keen to be part of a team that he feels \"has the potential to achieve great things.\"\nRhys played 23 games for the Pirates in his first season in Cornwall, when he was a clear top scorer with 181 points. Also, as a special highlight, he played for the Barbarians (along with Rhodri McAtee) against the Combined Services in the Annual Remembrance Day match.\nEarly in the summer of 2009, Rhys was further honoured when he was called into the Wales Sevens squad that competed in the final two tournaments of the season's IRB World Sevens Series, playing at both Twickenham and Murrayfield\n", "index": [[63, 78], [1239, 1254], [1276, 1287], [1293, 1304], [1323, 1337], [1348, 1353], [1387, 1392], [1396, 1400], [1498, 1508], [1514, 1524], [1565, 1576], [1587, 1598], [1637, 1647], [1696, 1706], [1738, 1750], [1851, 1856], [1895, 1899], [1946, 1959], [1968, 1975], [1989, 1997], [2174, 2181], [2205, 2213], [2311, 2321], [2334, 2347], [2361, 2378], [2499, 2511], [2577, 2600], [2618, 2628], [2633, 2644]], "wikipedia_ids": [3373095, 3373095, 314865, 21392239, 13939185, 770930, 25405, 21392239, 154957, 264230, 314865, 21392239, 963537, 3933705, 788504, 69894, 21392239, 863113, 985954, 5648, 3373095, 5648, 569077, 16039305, 6381746, 4431781, 185421, 871456, 1210642], "wikipedia_titles": ["Cornish Pirates", "Cornish Pirates", "Premiership Rugby", "Sale Sharks", "Kingsley Jones (rugby union, born 1969)", "Wales national rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sale Sharks", "New Zealand national rugby union team", "Jonah Lomu", "Premiership Rugby", "Sale Sharks", "Gloucester Rugby", "Grand Slam (rugby union)", "Neil Jenkins", "Wales", "Sale Sharks", "Cardiff Rugby", "Munster Rugby", "Cornwall", "Cornish Pirates", "Cornwall", "Barbarian F.C.", "Rhodri McAtee", "Combined Services cricket team", "Wales national rugby sevens team", "World Rugby Sevens Series", "Twickenham Stadium", "Murrayfield Stadium"]}

The tradition is that 1 and 2 Chronicles were written by Ezra.Date of Writing: The Book of 1 Chronicles was likely written between 450 and 425 B.C.Purpose of Writing: The Books of 1 & 2 Chronicles cover mostly the same information as 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings. 1 & 2 Chronicles focus more on the priestly aspect of the time period. The Book of 1 Chronicles was written after the exile to help those returning to Israel understand how to worship God.\u00a0The history focused on the Southern Kingdom, the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Levi.\u00a0These tribes tended to be more faithful to God.Key Verses: 1 Chronicles 11:1-2, \"All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, 'We are your own flesh and blood. In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the Lord said to you, \"You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.\"'\"1 Chronicles 21:13, \"David said to Gad, 'I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.'\"1 Chronicles 29:11, \"Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.\"Brief Summary: The first 9 chapters of 1 Chronicles are dedicated to lists and genealogies. Further lists and genealogies are scattered throughout the rest of 1 Chronicles. In between, the Book of 1 Chronicles records David's ascension to the throne and his actions thereafter. The book concludes with David's son Solomon becoming King of Israel. Briefly outlined, the Book of 1 Chronicles is as follows: Chapters 1:1-9:23 - Selective Genealogies; Chapters 9:24-12:40 - David\u2019s ascent; Chapters 13:1-20:30 -David\u2019s reign.Foreshadowings: In David\u2019s song of thanksgiving to God in 1 Chronicles 16:33, he refers to the time when God will come \u201cto judge the earth.\u201d This foreshadows Matthew 25, in which Jesus describes the time when He will come to judge the earth. Through the parables of the ten virgins and the talents, He warns that those who are found without the blood of Christ covering their sins will be cast into \u201couter darkness.\u201d He encourages His people to be ready because when He comes, He will separate the sheep from the goats in judgment.Part of the Davidic Covenant which God reiterates in chapter 17 refers to the future Messiah who would be a descendant of David. Verses 13-14 describe the Son who will be established in God\u2019s house and whose throne will be established forever. This can only refer to Jesus Christ.Practical Application: Genealogies such as the ones in 1 Chronicles may seem dry to us, but they remind us that God knows each of His children personally, even down to the number of hairs on our heads (Matthew 10:30). We can take comfort in the fact that who we are and what we do is written forever in God\u2019s mind. If we belong to Christ, our names are written forever in the Lamb\u2019s book of Life (Revelation 13:8). God is faithful to His people and keeps His promises. In the Book of 1 Chronicles, we see the fulfillment of God\u2019s promise to David when he is made king over all Israel (1 Chronicles 11:1-3). We can be sure that His promises to us will be fulfilled as well. He has promised blessings to those who follow Him, who come to Christ in repentance, and who obey His Word.Obedience brings blessing; disobedience brings judgment. The Book of 1 Chronicles, as well as 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings, is a chronicle of the pattern of sin, repentance, forgiveness, and restoration of the nation of Israel. In the same way, God is patient with us and forgives our sin when we come to Him in true repentance (1 John 1:9). We can take comfort in the fact that He hears our prayer of sorrow, forgives our sin, restores us to fellowship with Him, and sets us on the path to joy.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus\n", "index": [[1831, 1835], [1932, 1939], [2113, 2133], [2189, 2195], [2222, 2225], [2254, 2270], [2286, 2291], [2293, 2301], [2306, 2310], [2355, 2358], [2397, 2403], [2430, 2436], [2505, 2509], [2545, 2551], [2589, 2593], [2636, 2642], [2714, 2717], [2777, 2781], [3273, 3293], [3398, 3405], [3415, 3419], [3423, 3429], [3453, 3473], [3656, 3659], [3710, 3713], [3763, 3773], [3784, 3789], [3959, 3965], [4171, 4174], [4221, 4228], [4322, 4325], [4403, 4415], [4528, 4531], [4618, 4625], [4719, 4722], [4747, 4753], [4792, 4796], [4807, 4811], [4813, 4823], [4831, 4834], [4892, 4912], [4940, 4943], [4993, 4999], [5152, 5158], [5257, 5277], [5416, 5422], [5441, 5444], [5527, 5533], [5706, 5716], [5749, 5755]], "wikipedia_ids": [4332, 32977, 4319, 9282173, 5042765, 17423, 206652, 72326301, 246921, 5042765, 9282173, 38577, 28330, 9282173, 69304, 9282173, 4227675, 69304, 4319, 28329, 19012, 9282173, 4319, 5042765, 5042765, 3203465, 1095706, 1095706, 5042765, 19616, 5042765, 1095706, 5042765, 3203465, 5042765, 1095706, 229275, 187479, 26042, 5042765, 4319, 5042765, 9282173, 1095706, 4319, 9282173, 5042765, 2169532, 9845, 27871572], "wikipedia_titles": ["Book of Ezra", "Writing", "Books of Chronicles", "Israel", "God", "Kingdom of Judah", "Judah (son of Jacob)", "Tribe of Benjamin", "Levi", "God", "Israel", "Hebron", "Saul", "Israel", "Lord", "Israel", "Gad (prophet)", "Lord", "Books of Chronicles", "Solomon", "Monarch", "Israel", "Books of Chronicles", "God", "God", "Matthew 25", "Jesus", "Jesus", "God", "Messiah", "God", "Jesus", "God", "Matthew 25", "God", "Jesus", "Lamb and mutton", "Life (magazine)", "Revelation", "God", "Books of Chronicles", "God", "Israel", "Jesus", "Books of Chronicles", "Israel", "God", "John 1", "JavaScript", "Disqus"]}

I applaud NYSTAR for its support of this vital research,\" added Jackson.\nAs people begin adopting small-scale renewable sources to power homes and businesses, problems in the utility grid could arise because these sources are likely to be connected at the local distribution level. \"For example, I do not want my photovoltaic system's inverter to go off when my neighbor's central air conditioner comes on,\" said Nag Patibandla, director of Rensselaer's Center for Future Energy Systems (CFES). \"We want to understand how the distribution grid functions at a high degree of renewable resources penetration.\"\nPatibandla led New York's Distributed Generation program for five years before joining Rensselaer. For the new project, he and his colleagues plan to build a test system on the Rensselaer campus where they can attach a number of simulated renewable energy sources along with equipment that is susceptible to fluctuations in power output.\nExamples of sensitive loads include high-power computer systems, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in traffic lights, and wastewater treatment plants. Renewable energy sources are themselves inherently sensitive because they have inverters that convert direct current to alternating current, Patibandla said.\n\"The award to Rensselaer will enable it to strengthen its research and development activity in a critically important area of technology,\" said NYSTAR Executive Director Michael J. Relyea. \"It is one of many initiatives reflecting the vision and leadership of Governor Pataki and the Legislature.\nNYSTAR is thrilled to fund such economically worthwhile scientific endeavors at Rensselaer. The academic and private sector support that backs this important Rensselaer initiative on new energy systems is a testament to the incredible dynamic nature of research, development, and commercialization efforts ongoing at Rensselaer.\"\nResearchers at the CFES will be partnering with Sensitron Semiconductor of Deer Park, NY; Inverters Unlimited Inc. of Albany, NY; and Advanced Energy Conversion of Malta, NY The project also will examine policy aspects of renewable resources penetration in partnership with the Pace Energy Project, part of Pace Law School's Center for Environmental Legal Studies.\n\"With growing concern over the security of our energy supply and its consequences for the global climate, energy is emerging as one of the defining public policy issue of our generation,\" said Pace Law School Dean Stephen Friedman.\n\"Pace is pleased to join with Rensselaer on this important initiative to define the technological, economic, and regulatory framework for supporting renewable energy and clean distributed generation as an ever-increasing part of our future energy mix.\"\nThe CFES, in partnership with Cornell University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Clarkson University, seeks to meet the energy challenges of the 21st century by focusing on innovation in and commercialization of energy conservation and renewable energy systems.\nThe new project will expand the current efforts in technology commercialization at CFES into the area of distributed power generation, or the use of small-scale generators located close to the power load being served. Specifically, the researchers will examine the stability and dynamic behavior of the electricity grid, the feasibility of installing distributed energy to counter-balance natural intermittency, and grid stability and power quality, Patibandla said.\nThe award is being made through NYSTAR's Centers for Advanced Technology Development Program, which seeks to enhance and expand the capabilities of existing Centers for Advanced Technology that have achieved a record of success.\nIn addition to Patibandla, two Rensselaer researchers will be co-principal investigators: Jian Sun, associate professor of electrical, computer, and systems engineering; and Nadarajah Narendran, director of research at Rensselaer's Lighting Research Center. The project also will support six Rensselaer graduate students.\nCommunity\nEmail This Article\nComment On This Article\nRelated Links\nRensselaer Polytechnic InstitutePowering The World in the 21st Century at Energy-Daily.com\nPowering The World in the 21st Century at Energy-Daily.com\nSearch All Our Sites - Powered By Google\nENERGY TECH\nDespite Start Up Problems Carbon Markets Are Here To Stay\nNairobi (AFP) Nov 10, 2006\nThe carbon market, the jewel in the crown of the Kyoto Protocol, is a flawed gem but one likely to endure, regardless of the form that international efforts take to tackle climate change, experts here say.

Following last season's exploits that led the Seagulls to the Npower League One title, Gus Poyet's side go into the Championship full of renewed hope and optimism for what lies ahead.One player not looking to dwell on the niceties that come with the opening of a new home is Gary Dicker, who says the players must adapt quickly to their new surroundings in order to continue pushing in the right direction.\"It's a big pitch,\" the 25-year-old confirmed. \"We have to get used to playing here when it is full. We need to punish teams when we have the ball. If we can make this place hard to play in for other teams, it will be a massive thing for us.\"I've played at Wembley before, but this pitch feels bigger - it is beautiful to play on.\"Brighton could be regarded as having an outside chance for back-to-back promotions, but if one thing is certain it's that Poyet has got the Seagull's back playing football the right way.\nThe headline summer signing of Craig Mackail-Smith will undoubtedly add extra firepower to their ranks, but a realistic target of consolidation and\na top half finish will ensure the feel-good factor remains at Brighton for another season at least.Scotland international Mackail-Smith, however, will miss the club\u2019s Carling Cup tie with Gillingham next week because of his latest call-up to the national squad \u2013 much to the annoyance of manager Gus Poyet.The Brighton boss said: \u201cWe will always respect players who want to play for their countries so we won't stop him from going. Saying that, it's not very clever when you put an international game in the middle of a week when you have a cup game.\"This is Scotland, not Australia or Argentina. I think they knew from two months ago that it was a Carling Cup week and there are a few Scottish players in England.\"I am not going to fight the Scottish FA over it. I am going to give him the freedom to go. I loved playing for Uruguay. I will never stop a player playing for their national team.\"I am very pleased for Craig and I would, of course, like him to play. It would be very disappointing if he goes to Scotland, misses the Gillingham game and doesn't play, so it's up to the manager.\"Championship Winners- 18/1Promoted - 6/1\nFancy a flutter on the big game?

(2002) randomly selected 10% (N=857) of employees to receive surveys regarding their substance use behaviors during the previous 12 months.\u00a0 Of these eligible employees, 504 sent back completed surveys. Respondents were 62.8% female and ranged in age from 21 to 78 (M=43.8).\u00a0 Eighty one percent of the sample earned a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher and 3% earned a high school diploma or less.\nTable 1 summarizes the survey results.\u00a0 The results reveal that alcohol and licit drug use was more prevalent than illicit substance use among this sample.\u00a0 A significant number of employees however, reported illicit drug use during the past year.\u00a0 Based on responses to the CAGE (Ewing, 1984), 12% qualified for \u201clikely to have lifetime alcohol dependence.\u201d Responses to the AUDIT (Bush, Kivlahan, Mcdonnell, Fihn, & Bradley, 1998) indicated that 5% had a \u201chigh likelihood of alcohol abuse.\u201d\nIn addition, 3% claimed that their alcohol consumption caused injury to someone else.\u00a0 Despite these results only a handful of employees reported receiving any substance abuse treatment over the last year.\nTable 1. Past year substance use among employees (N=504)\nThere are several limitations to this study.\nFor example, the 60% response rate might result in substance use differences between those that completed and those that did not complete the survey.\nIn addition, this survey was conducted in 1999, and it is possible that substance use behaviors among highly educated employees have changed since then.\u00a0 Finally, substance use might be a more sensitive topic for the highly educated, perhaps biasing the self-report in the direction of underreporting.\nDespite constraints that might limit the extent of reported substance use and related problems, this study confirms that substance use and abuse is not an issue reserved only for less educated individuals.\u00a0 There is a need for employee prevention and intervention programs in work forces populated by the highly educated.\nAssuming that educated individuals are immune to substance use problems might diminish their chances of getting the help they need.\nReferences\nBush, K., Kivlahan, DR, Mcdonnell, MB, Fihn, SD, & Bradley, K.

I don\u2019t follow sports but he\u2019s been in too many news headlines lately to be overlooked. Reportedly he\u2019s not a very good athlete but he won 6 out of the 7 matches in which he played so far. He would give all credits to God and that\u2019s when the controversies started. Tebow is the son of a Pastor and a devout Christian. He would go down on one knee and bow his head to pray before the arena throng after each touchdown. Naturally this pose of a 6\u20193\u201d prominently built athlete stirred admiration and criticism at the same time. People all over the world are posting on web pages pictures of themselves posing like Tebow. There\u2019re web sites dedicated to Tebowing, as they\u2019d call it. However, it\u2019s the even more feverish criticisms that brought Tim Tebow to my attention. Critics are disturbed by his open proclamation of his Christianity and celibacy before marriage. A columnist on Jewish Weekly posted a message that said a Super Bowl victory by the Evangelical Christian Quarterback could incite others to burn mosques, bash gays and banish immigrants. The columnist is a highly respected Jewish leader Rabbi Joshua Hammerman. I must say his imagination knows no bound. Not in my wildest dreams would evangelical Christians burn mosques. Many Jews came to America after World War II because America was a free country. They can safely practice Judaism here and should respect that Christians have the right to practice Christianity also. You just can\u2019t mistake a Jew just because of their unique attire. Then why would it be an issue when Christians proclaim what they are? Tebow has not done any more than expressing his identity. He didn\u2019t pray aloud. He didn\u2019t give a sermon. If stating his religion is enough to disturb you, do you also find the long coats of Jews and turbans of Muslims in the summer heat disturbing? As far as gays are concerned, it\u2019s clearly stated in the bible that homosexuality is a sin, and any Christians would say it as it is regardless of Tim Tebow. At least Christians would not take it upon themselves to punish sinners. Regarding immigrants, I believe many Christians are immigrants themselves and why would they banish immigrants? Rabbi Hammerman apologized about his posting later but it\u2019s like asking the jurors to ignore an attorney\u2019s baseless accusations after it\u2019s been deliberated in the court. Is it possible? Jews live in their own communities, study at their own schools and ignore public media. With such a biased religious leader, the biased views will only accentuate themselves. Rabbi Hammerman wasn\u2019t the only biased critic. The former Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer also said that he wished Tebow would keep quiet about his religion. Riverhead High School in Long Island recently suspended two student athletes for a day for Tebowing in the corridor. The school denied that the suspension was motivated by religion. They said it was dangerous when students gathered to watch. When I was in high school, I\u2019d seen much worse than several kneeling boys. That\u2019s a pretty lame excuse. There\u2019re students who dress weirdly like pop icons such as Lady Gaga and you don\u2019t see any suspension because of that. Now a few boys were imitating an athlete with some moral conviction, one who vowed to abstain from pre-marital sex, and they got disciplined. What\u2019s happening? A few months ago, the announcement of a retired football player about his homosexuality was met with standing ovation nationwide. He was seen as a hero. Now a young football star proclaims his Christianity and he is met with hostility. In America, you can openly talk about your sexual orientation, plastic surgery and adultery. You can divorce your spouse after 72 days of marriage and still remain highly popular. Nothing incites as much insult as being Christian. The military rule Don't Ask, Don't Tell has been abolished after Obama became the president. That rule no longer applies to gays in the military. I have a feeling Americans are trying to enforce the Don't Ask, Don't Tell rule on Christians\n", "index": [[507, 516], [523, 540], [549, 563], [783, 786], [830, 835], [872, 881], [1176, 1181], [1305, 1314], [1386, 1398], [1487, 1497], [1777, 1787], [1807, 1811], [1820, 1827], [1834, 1846], [1855, 1862], [1908, 1915], [1945, 1955], [1983, 1995], [2027, 2030], [2103, 2113], [2138, 2143], [2328, 2332], [2348, 2355], [2487, 2497], [2534, 2543], [2554, 2564], [2655, 2665], [3149, 3156], [3169, 3181], [3207, 3212], [3275, 3286], [3655, 3664], [4068, 4080], [4114, 4121], [4331, 4340], [4360, 4381], [4407, 4412], [4505, 4514], [4541, 4562], [4571, 4581]], "wikipedia_ids": [18582416, 18951490, 8122, 5042765, 18582416, 18337522, 18582416, 18582416, 5211, 27718, 18337522, 25955086, 3434750, 32927, 3434750, 15624, 18337522, 5211, 25955086, 18337522, 18582416, 25955086, 19541, 18337522, 18582416, 18337522, 18337522, 8122, 966602, 18582416, 18315, 17782843, 5211, 3434750, 18337522, 8690, 534366, 3434750, 8690, 18337522], "wikipedia_titles": ["Tim Tebow", "American football", "Denver Broncos", "God", "Tim Tebow", "Christians", "Tim Tebow", "Tim Tebow", "Christianity", "Super Bowl", "Christians", "Jews", "United States", "World War II", "United States", "Judaism", "Christians", "Christianity", "Jews", "Christians", "Tim Tebow", "Jews", "Muslims", "Christians", "Tim Tebow", "Christians", "Christians", "Denver Broncos", "Jake Plummer", "Tim Tebow", "Long Island", "Lady Gaga", "Christianity", "United States", "Christians", "Don't ask, don't tell", "Barack Obama", "United States", "Don't ask, don't tell", "Christians"]}

Wells, who is variously described as a \"veteran presence\" and a \"hothead,\" may never see a minute in a regular-season game for Minnesota, instead functioning as a camp / practice player. Wells has been in camp for several days, but was only yesterday cleared by FIBA to sign a contract.\nThat said, it's a confusing signing, to say the least. After the jump, the top ten reasons the Wolves signed Wells.\nThe team was looking for someone who remembers the Ford Administration.\nOther slightly older shooting guards, like George Gervin, were unavailable.\nThe team has been looking to fill the all-important \"make obscene gestures at fans\" role.\nHaving not played since 2008, he won't have seen how bad the Wolves have been lately in person.\nEverybody else wanted to be paid in money.\nThe Wolves just wanted somebody new for Nik Pekovic to foul in practice.\nRick Adelman needed someone he can trust to wear a wire into the locker room.\nDavid Kahn just realized he managed to construct an entire roster without a shooting guard, and got desperate.\nWells can teach some young players the various lessons he's learned during his NBA career, such as \"what to do if an opponent blocks the team bus in the parking lot and comes after you with a gun.\"\nNobody could find Antoine Walker's phone number.\nTweet\n15 comments\n|\n0 recs \u00a0|\nDo you like this story?\nMore from Canis Hoopus\n2 minutes of\u00a0fun\nDec 2011 by Stop-n-Pop\n- 465 comments\nAround SB Nation\nTonight's Game: Orlando Magic vs. New Orleans Hornets.

According to the National Violence Against Women Survey, 17.6% of women will be raped\nduring her lifetime.4\n\"A Crime Against Women\"\nAlthough men are more likely to be victims of violent\ncrime overall, a recent study by the U.S. Department of\nJustice reports that \"intimate partner violence is primarily\na crime against women.\"2\nOf those victimized by an intimate partner, 85% are women\nand 15% are men.2 In other words, women are 5 to 8 times\nmore likely than men to be victimized by an intimate\npartner.3\nThe vast majority of domestic assaults are committed by\nmen. Even when men are victimized, 10% are assaulted by\nanother man. In contrast, only 2% of women who are victimized\nare assaulted by another woman.2\nVulnerability Factors\nWomen age 16 to 24 are most likely to be victimized by\nan intimate partner.2\nAfrican-American women experience more domestic\nviolence than White women in the age group of 20-24. However,\nBlack and White women experience the same level of\nvictimization in all other age categories.2\nHispanic women are less likely to be victimized\nthan non-Hispanic women in every age group.2\nWomen are most vulnerable to violence when separated from their intimate partner. The second most vulnerable\ngroup are those who are divorced.2 This can discourage women from leaving their abusive partner,\nout of fear that it will increase their risk of victimization.\nPhysical Injury\nApproximately 40-50% of female victims are physically\ninjured when assaulted by their intimate partner,2,\n4 accounting for over 200,000 visits to the hospital\nemergency room each year.5\nOnly about 1 in 5 of domestic violence victims with\nphysical injuries seek professional medical treatment.3\nMurder\nWomen are far more likely than men to be murdered by an\nintimate partner. Of those murdered by their intimate partner,\n74% are women and 26% are men.2 In\nother words, nearly 3 out of 4 of the murders committed\nby intimate partners have a female victim.\nThe FBI reports that between 1976 and 1996, domestic violence\nclaims the lives of more than four women each day.3\nBetween 1976 and 1996, there was a \"sharp decrease\" in\nthe number of men murdered by intimate partners, whereas\nthe number of women murdered by an intimate partner remained\nconstant.3 Some have attributed this\nto the increasing availability of shelters which provide\nbattered women with options other than killing an abusive\npartner. It is possible that some women who might have otherwise\nkilled their abuser are able to leave and go to a shelter.\nUnder-reporting of\nDomestic Violence to Police\nOnly about half of domestic violence incidents are reported\nto police. African-American women are more likely than others\nto report their victimization to police.3\nThe most common reasons for not reporting domestic violence\nto police are that victims view the incident as a personal\nor private matter, they fear retaliation from their abuser,\nand they do not believe that police will do anything about\nthe incident.3\nEven with this dramatic under-reporting, domestic violence\ncalls constitute approximately half of all violent crime\ncalls to police departments. For example, 49% of the violent\ncrime calls received by the DC Metropolitan Police Department\nin 2000 were for domestic violence incidents.6\nPolice Response Frequently\nInadequate\nSkepticism regarding the quality of police response is\ngrounded in reality. A recent study by the D.C. Metropolitan\nPolice Department concluded that there was a \"clear and\npervasive pattern\" of departures from departmental policy.6\nFor example, in only one-third of the domestic\nviolence calls did an officer take photographs or ask about\nprior abuse.6\nOnly 17% of the victims were asked about a restraining\norder, and 83% were provided no printed information with contact information or resources.6\nThe Myth of \"Mutuality\"\nAlthough many studies report that men and women use physical\nviolence at equal rates within intimate relationships,7,\n8 this fails to take into account the nature of the\nviolence and the level of fear and injury experienced by\neach party.\nSeveral studies document that women experience higher\nlevels of fear than men do in domestic violence situations.9,\n10, 11, 12, 13 This is perhaps because women in domestic\nviolence situations are much more likely to be injured --\nand injured severely -- than men are.8,\n12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\nRecent years have seen an increase in the number of women\narrested for domestic violence. For example, the percentage\nof women arrested for domestic violence increased in Concord,\nNew Hampshire from 23% in 1993 to 35% in 1999. Vermont saw\na similar increase from 16% in 1997 to 23% in 1999.18\nSome have attributed this to the increase in \"mandatory\narrest\" policies, in which police are required to make an\narrest if there is probable cause that a person has committed\ndomestic violence. Passage of these laws was advocated by\nfeminists and domestic violence experts to address the inadequate\nresponse to domestic violence victims by law enforcement.\nWhen officers arrive at the scene of a domestic violence\ncrime, they often cite evidence that both partners have\nengaged in some aggressive behavior, and arrest both the\nman and the woman. This \"dual arrest\" strategy fails to\ntake into account which of two people is primarily responsible\nfor the aggression and which one is responding out of self-defense,\nand can have devastating effects, particularly if there\nare children involved in the relationship.\nTo counteract this problem, some departmental or statewide\npolicies now provide guidelines for an officer to determine\nwho is the \"primary aggressor\" in a violent incident. For\nexample, the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards\nand Training publishes a guidebook for officers responding\nto domestic violence, discouraging \"dual arrests\" and outlining\nseveral factors to consider when determining who is the\nprimary aggressor in a domestic violence situation. The\nprimary aggressor is defined as \"the person determined to\nbe the most significant, rather than the first, aggressor.\"\nFactors to consider include the history of domestic violence\nbetween the people involved, the threats and fear level\nof each person, and whether either person acted in self\ndefense. These are appropriate considerations when determining\nwho is the primary aggressor, and therefore which of the\ntwo parties should be arrested.20\nPolice Training Resources\nFor more information or to identify expert law enforcement\ntrainers in the area of domestic violence, please contact\nthe National Center for Women & Policing.

In this post, we\u2019ll look at how to start a business while avoiding costly pitfalls or embarrassments.\nImage by Valerie Everett; some rights reserved.\nYour Business Name\nIf you\u2019ve wanted to start a business for awhile now, you may have had your business name selected for years\u2014but it\u2019s important that you do a little bit of research before running with the business name of your dreams so that you don\u2019t have any nasty surprises cropping up in the future.\nTrademarks\nWhen you register your business name with your state or local government, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll do a name search for availability before placing your business on file. However, it\u2019s important to note that\u00a0state acceptance of your chosen business name is not to be taken as broad permission to use it, nor does it imply that you have exclusive rights to the name.\nYour Secretary of State will search state records to make sure there\u2019s no other business entity of the same type on file with the same name; other business filings, such as county DBA registrations, may or may not be subject to a similar search. But this search is done only to ensure compliance with that state\u2019s name availability guidelines; it does not, for example, check records of neighboring states for business name similarities.\nInstead, it\u2019s your responsibility to check trademark registrations, both with the US Patent and Trademark Office and other state and local agencies. Additionally, look into the various public databases that collect and archive information on unregistered trademarks, as registration is not necessary for all trademark benefits.\nSigns and Logos\nImage by Steve Wilson; some rights reserved.\nConsider a spa and wellness center called Aloha Dreams Hawaiian Destinations. It sounds like a beautiful place to relax\u2014until you drive up and see a big sign that says \u201cADHD\u201d out front.\nOr what about Peter, who didn\u2019t realize his Military Surplus shop sign would cause 13-year-old boys to snigger about the female reproductive system.\nIt\u2019s important to look at your business name at all angles. If any iteration of it has the potential to shock or induce giggles, it might be worth reconsidering.\nYour Industry Competitors\nYou wouldn\u2019t enter a fight without checking out the competition, would you? The NFL greats watch video of upcoming opponents to scope out any weaknesses and use them to their best advantage. If you want to attract customers, you need to know what their experience is with your competitors so you know how to make their experience with you a better one.\nTry surreptitiously placing an order with one of the giants in your field. If it\u2019s a service, take careful note of their language, how they\u2019re treating you, and what areas you, as a customer, might wish to be improved on. If it\u2019s a product, note the packaging, the presentation, and the product itself.\nNow, think of ways that you could not only measure up, but take the lead. If they include a printed thank-you note, you might make yours handwritten. If they use a great deal of packaging, you might make it a point to use less, and advertise your company\u2019s commitment to reducing your carbon footprint.\nAlways look for ways to make your business better than the competitors. (And remember: if you don\u2019t\u00a0have\u00a0any competitors, it\u2019s possible you maybe have taken a wrong turn. All industries have competitors.)\nYour Ongoing Compliance Requirements\nSimply registering your business name isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ll need to comply with the requirements of local, state, and federal offices and agencies, and many of those requirements\u2014and the relevant agencies themselves\u2014depend on your business structure and industry.\nPublication Requirements\nMany states require DBAs, or unincorporated Doing Business As businesses (such as sole proprietorships), to publish notice of their filing in a newspaper of general circulation in the business\u2019s county; examples include California and Pennsylvania. Many other states require new corporations and LLCs to do the same.\nCheck your filing jurisdiction\u2019s website (typically your Secretary of State or County Clerk) for specific requirements, and make sure you understand all of the details. (Is it enough to simply publish notice, or do you have to file proof of publication with your state government?)\nImage by Jason Dirks; some rights reserved.\nIRS Requirements: EIN\nAny time you earn money throughout the year, you\u2019ll need to report your income to the IRS. Not all business structures require an EIN\u2014sole proprietorships, for example, may use the sole proprietor\u2019s Social Security Number, if they wish\u2014but whatever the case, if you\u2019re making money, the IRS wants to know.\nState Taxes\nYou\u2019ll also need to register your business with your state tax office, especially if you have employees, since you\u2019ll also need to pay state taxes. To do this, you\u2019ll receive a State Tax ID number, typically from your state\u2019s Department of Revenue, Tax Assessor, or other office. Contact your Secretary of State\u2014they\u2019ll be able to point you in the right direction!\nBusiness Licenses and Permits\nDepending on your activities, you may be required to obtain business licenses or permits from any number of city, county, or state government agencies. For example, you may need a city sales permit, in addition to any regulatory licenses for those sales (gun permit, liquor license, and so on).\nOther Requirements\nThis is not to be taken as a comprehensive list of all of your business responsibilities. Rather, it should get you started thinking about what types of government agencies and offices you might need to contact to determine any potential next steps forward after starting your business.\nImage by velkr0; some rights reserved.\nRemember, a corporate lawyer or legal advisor can help you make these determinations and keep you in compliance so you don\u2019t have potentially hefty fines and late fees crop up.\nGood luck!\nShare and Enjoy:\nTAGS: business license, business name, competitor, compliance, dba, doing business as, ein, federal, industry, IRS, irs requirement, logo, logos, publication requirement, signs, start a business, state tax, tax id, trademark, unregistered trademark, us patent and trademark office, uspto\nPosted in\nStart a Business\nComments (0)\nFriday Favorites: Social Media Edition\nPosted By Sarah on Friday 24 February 2012\nThis week\u2019s collection of outstandingly helpful/witty/otherwise awesome blog posts focus on Social Media.\nThere\u2019s a fine line between using Social Media as a useful free tool, and using it as a colossal waste of time.

Where years ago uncovering a source of bootlegged editions might take months, if not years, material uploaded to the Internet is discoverable almost immediately. Here\u2019s how you can stay vigil and cast your net for improper use of your material.\nGoogle Images\nYou know that Google Images is a great way to search the Internet for images by keyword, but did you know you can also use it to look for duplicates of a specific image? If you\u2019ve been doing your Google searches in the little corner tab on your browser, but you haven\u2019t been to the homepage lately (since around June of 2011), you may not be aware of this feature\u2014but it\u2019s key to searching the Internet for your material if you\u2019re a painter, photographer, or other visual artist.\nGive it a shot\u2014head over to Google\u2019s homepage and look in the search bar: you\u2019ll see a little camera. Click that, upload the picture you\u2019re looking for, and voil\u00e0\u2014you\u2019ll know who\u2019s been hosting your material before you can say Click.\nTinEye\nBefore Google, there was TinEye. This small Canadian company was using image recognition software far before Google implemented it (Google image searches were previously text-based and relied on tags and descriptions), and they have a very small, dedicated team that has been working for years to categorize and make available literally billions of images. Their parent company, Id\u00e9e Inc, has produced other image recognition software programs that you may find useful on your hunt.\nSearch in Quotes\nAnd then there\u2019s my personal favorite, useful for locating written material: just go to your favorite search engine and type in the first sentence or two in quotes. The results will show you where the written material has been reprinted. (It\u2019s also a serviceable, if inelegant, way of connecting snippets of lyrics to the songs and bands responsible, I\u2019ve found.)\nImage courtesy of Alan Klim; some rights reserved\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s important to be aware and engaged. And if you do find that your copyrighted material is being hosted somewhere without your permission, it\u2019s always a good idea to send a friendly request that your music is taken down. After all, not everyone is aware that it\u2019s not legal to repost pictures or photographs belonging to someone else; there may be no malice intended, and the person using your work might take it down immediately with apologies. (Or, of course, it\u2019s your right to allow them to keep using the image, provided they attribute it to you and link back to your sight.)\nAnd if you don\u2019t receive a response, there\u2019s one more alternative before jumping into a legal battle: a Cease and Desist form.\n[For more information, check out our April '11 post, \"Cease And Desist Letter: The Affordable Way To Battle Copyright Infringement.\"]\nHappy hunting!\nShare and Enjoy:\nTAGS: cease and desist, copyright, copyright infringement, copyrighted material, google images, idee inc, image recognition, painting, photo, tineye\nPosted in\nintellectual property\nComments (0)\nFriday Favorites: February 13-17\nPosted By Sarah on Friday 17 February 2012\nGood things are happening in the business blogosphere, and we want to share them with you!

But thanks to Tim Gieseke and EcoCommerce 101, now we can.\nEcoCommerce 101: Adding an ecological dimension to the economy\nAccording to Gieseke, \u201cEcoCommerce . . . provides the framework to build an ecological intelligence system that allows the public arena of commerce to define sustainability.\u201d\nGieseke shows us that economic development and bio-ecological preservation are more inherently connected than you might think, and that the \u00a0two goals can be met (and, in fact, are one and the same) with coordinated effort and a renewed dedication to seeing economy and ecology through the same lens.\nGieseke points out that \u201csustainability\u201d is defined by us, the participants in the economy. EcoCommerce 101\u00a0is a roadmap for reshaping the market to support a sustainable future we can all be proud of.\nComment to win!\nWe\u2019ve got three copies of EcoCommerce 101\u00a0to give away, and we want you to have one of them!

The sooner you file your Articles of Incorporation, the closer you are to opening your doors and sharing your business with the world\u2014so it\u2019s important to fully understand your incorporation requirements from the beginning to avoid any lengthy delays or rejections.\nIn most states, having a registered agent on file is one of those requirements. This Q&A is designed to better understand your registered agent requirements as well as highlight potential concerns involved in acting as registered agent yourself.\nImage courtesy of Allen Sima; some rights reserved.\nWhat is a registered agent?\nWhen a business is incorporated, it becomes a legal entity\u2014a legal person\u2014just like you and me. (Of course, a corporation has limited rights and powers; a corporation cannot vote or be married, for example.) But for practical reasons, a corporation must have an individual as the point person for the business, someone to whom correspondence may be sent or legal papers may be served. (It\u2019s hard to have a face-to-face interaction with something as abstract as a business entity.)\nA registered agent is that point person. If the state needs to send a notice to your company regarding any compliance news or filing deadlines, they send the notice to the registered agent. If someone sues your small business, the registered agent is served on behalf of the corporation. Or if another company needs your permission in order to register a name similar to yours, the contact information available to them is the registered agent\u2019s.\nWhat types of businesses need a registered agent?\nAny business that has been organized at the state level and is a separate legal entity from its owners is required to have a registered agent on file: corporations, limited liability companies, and nonprofit organization, for example, are all required to provide a registered agent in their Articles of Incorporation (or Organization, in the case of an LLC). Foreign corporations\u2014businesses that first incorporated in one state and then expanded into and registered with another\u2014are also required to list a registered agent in each state.\n[Note: there are a few states, such as Minnesota and New York\n", "index": [[2038, 2056], [2213, 2216], [2553, 2583], [3463, 3466], [5092, 5102], [5107, 5119], [5246, 5264], [5268, 5280], [5623, 5626], [5736, 5758], [5824, 5827], [6081, 6102], [6104, 6116], [7597, 7609], [7645, 7657], [8035, 8042], [8538, 8547], [8592, 8598], [9181, 9189], [9481, 9489], [9541, 9549], [10711, 10724], [10893, 10899], [11205, 11211], [11404, 11409], [11425, 11431], [11462, 11470], [11527, 11533], [11550, 11556], [13042, 13058], [14304, 14307], [17672, 17678], [18131, 18156], [19967, 19992], [19997, 20009], [20254, 20263], [20268, 20276]], "wikipedia_ids": [32293, 230404, 218363, 21211, 5407, 23332, 32293, 32358912, 23430752, 22255742, 23430752, 19940642, 10556434, 5897742, 5897742, 9988187, 32826316, 61978, 7958109, 14288, 7529378, 5376827, 1092923, 1092923, 7816, 1092923, 5042916, 1092923, 1092923, 477954, 23430752, 90451, 2372940, 2372940, 105070, 19590, 645042], "wikipedia_titles": ["United States Secretary of State", "Trade name", "United States Patent and Trademark Office", "National Football League", "California", "Pennsylvania", "United States Secretary of State", "Municipal clerk", "Internal Revenue Service", "Social Security number", "Internal Revenue Service", "Pennsylvania Department of Revenue", "Tax assessment", "Social media", "Social media", "Twitter", "Pinterest", "Nelson, New Zealand", "Stanford Cardinal football", "Hamilton, Ontario", "Facebook", "Google Images", "Google", "Google", "Click consonant", "Google", "Canada", "Google", "Google", "Cease and desist", "Internal Revenue Service", "Amazon (company)", "Articles of association", "Articles of association", "Organization", "Minnesota", "New York City"]}

{"id": "clueweb12-0500wb-33-03178", "bracket": "0.4-0.5", "text": "DavidByrne.com - The New Sins - Eye Magazine Review\nThe New Sins\n\"Unclassifiable Book\"\nBy Rick Poynor, Eye Magazine no. 43 vol. 11\nSin is one of those words that has all but disappeared from our everyday vocabulary. To have a concept of sin, you need to believe in an old-fashioned, fire-and-brimstone God, keeping a tally on our moral progress in this world. Yet sin, when we pause to think about it, remains a powerful idea, if only because it suggests a set of external limits and a personal accountability that we often boast of leaving behind.\nSo a book titled The New Sins is bound to be provocative, and this one, printed by an Icelandic maker of Bibles, comes clad in the foil-blocked,mock leather trappings of an authentic religious tract. The cover records that it has been \u2018Translated out of the original tongues with the former translations diligently compared and revised\u2019 \u2013 words taken from the King James version of the Bible. The title page attributes its wisdom to \u2018The Better-Emancipated Strivers for Heaven\u2019. Anyone encountering The New Sins stripped of the publisher\u2019s bellyband will have to look hard to discover that its actual author is former Talking Head, photographer, film-maker, and Luaka Bop record label founder David Byrne, who created it for an art biennial in Valencia, Spain.\nFrom his earliest songs, Byrne combined a heart-on-sleeve sincerity with postmodern irony, playfulness and ambiguity. People assumed he was poking fun at eccentric Texans in his film True Stories, but he insisted that he regarded its cast of kooks with affection. He used the strange hand gestures of evangelical preachers as the basis for a memorably weird dance routine, and his \u2018new sins\u2019 mix humour with semi-serious intent in much the same way. According to Byrne\u2019s oddball reasoning, some of it modified from real religious texts, everything we mistakenly believe to be virtuous \u2013 charity, sense of humour, beauty, thrift, ambition, hope, intelligence/knowledge, contentment, sweetness, honesty and cleanliness \u2013 is a sin of the most insidious kind.\nByrne\u2019s tone of religiose exhortation is impressively sustained, but it\u2019s the nicely judged visual treatment of his questionable arguments that ultimately makes the book. The text, in English and Spanish, is illustrated by 80 of his photographs, deadpan depictions of objects, surfaces, quirky details \u2013 contentment is a plant trimmed into the shape of rabbit, ambition a swarm of ants, hell the empty corner of an office. Byrne calls the pictures \u2018software programs for the eye\u2019 and observes that the text is merely a distraction, a device to make you spend longer looking at the images.\nByrne asked Dave Eggers, editor and designer of the cult literary magazine McSweeney's, (see Eye no. 35 vol. 9) to design The New Sins. Eggers showed him examples of Bibles in his own collection, and his page designs, each one framed by red and black box rules, have a kind of artless elegance. Headings in italic capitals and various arbitrary key words \u2013 \u2018better fiction\u2019, \u2018invisible to the giver\u2019, \u2018hydraulic pipes\u2019 \u2013 are picked out in red. Some passages have marginal notes in smaller type similar to those in early Bibles.\nWhere Byrne\u2019s previous book, Your Action World, designed by Stefan Sagmeister, laboured its plasticky ironies in a way that some found too obvious, The New Sins infiltrates the mind with a subtler touch. As an object, it is small enough to carry in the pocket and dip into and to try out, as Byrne himself has done, on people who don\u2019t know he wrote it. From his early collaborations with M&Co, Byrne has made astute use of graphic design, but that doesn\u2019t stop him consigning designers, along with website managers and relief workers, to the upper levels of hell. \u2018Their crime? Hubris. Their punishment? Equality. Everyone looks cool, fashionable and absolutely identical \u2013 well-dressed, handsome and completely boring. Everything is perfect and unbearable.\u2019\nThe most appealing thing about The New Sins is the way that it resists definition. Coming from pop music, Byrne has a light touch and few have proved smarter, over the years, in using the medium as a vehicle for diverse artistic ends. You could see The New Sins as an artist\u2019s book but, despite its weighty themes, it has none of the portentousness of the genre and it is easy to buy.

However this is interrupted when both are arrested for aiding in the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow's escape. The new captain, Beckett, will lift all charges, if Will can hunt down Jack and bring him back to Beckett, along with his magic compass. However, Jack has other problems. Years ago, he made a deal with Davy Jones to raise the Black Pearl. Time is up. His part of the deal was to give Davy Jones his soul. Once Will finds Jack, unaware of the current situation, Jack coaxes Will into boarding Davy Jones's ship, the Flying Dutchman, and retrieve a mysterious key. This key opens the chest that contains Davy Jones's secret. With it, you can control Davy Jones and his fearsome beast, The Kraken. Once Will retrieves said key, Davy Jones is hot on his trail, now hunting down both Jack and Will. It is now, only a matter of time, before something happens. Hopefully the pirates can reach the chest and stop Davy Jones\n", "index": [[180, 187], [580, 587], [590, 604], [877, 885], [986, 994], [1112, 1118], [1374, 1382], [1418, 1426], [1642, 1646], [1744, 1755], [1861, 1873], [1930, 1933], [1995, 2003], [2176, 2191], [2309, 2319], [2398, 2416], [2486, 2503], [2511, 2522], [2534, 2550], [2588, 2595], [2640, 2647], [3277, 3282], [3412, 3421], [3526, 3538], [3605, 3616], [3621, 3635], [3734, 3754], [3817, 3821], [3836, 3840], [3911, 3915], [3967, 3977], [3991, 4002], [4049, 4059], [4075, 4079], [4086, 4090], [4126, 4130], [4138, 4142], [4157, 4167], [4267, 4277], [4313, 4323], [4352, 4358], [4365, 4369], [4390, 4400], [4444, 4448], [4453, 4457], [4570, 4580]], "wikipedia_ids": [226664, 18617829, 18617829, 30118, 21647, 8522, 9239, 645042, 255413, 149692, 1804285, 32927, 14155, 558824, 21649, 39034, 19603, 49706, 60540, 160483, 60540, 24095, 265059, 379472, 616917, 900291, 333335, 616917, 18617829, 18617829, 3323587, 3811567, 3323587, 616917, 18617829, 18617829, 616917, 3323587, 3323587, 3323587, 4497844, 616917, 3323587, 18617829, 616917, 3323587], "wikipedia_titles": ["About Schmidt", "Jack Nicholson", "Jack Nicholson", "Tanzania", "Nebraska", "Denver", "Europe", "New York City", "New York City Police Department", "Buju Banton", "Wayne Wonder", "World War II", "Hebrides", "Ealing comedies", "New Mexico", "J.

The lively Mark Griffin belatedly celebrated his 20th birthday as he had his side in cruise control with two fine finishes, only for ex-Lilywhite Chris Turner to pop up with a lifeline 11 minutes from time before Billy Dennehy struck in injury-time to earn the Hoops an undeserved 2-2 draw.\nHeartbreaking\nThe result came following extremely disappointing defeats, for very different reasons, by Drogheda United and Saint Patrick's Athletic. But Foster felt the draw in Dublin 24 was even more galling. \u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult result to take this season,\u201d Ian told dundalkfc.com. \u201cI don\u2019t think we deserved to drop any points tonight. The players were fabulous. It was a wonderful effort from all of them. It\u2019s heartbreaking to concede at such a late stage. You would expect when you come to the champions that they might get the ball in wide areas and break you down that way, but they\u2019ve gone route one and stuck balls into our box. They haven\u2019t carved us open or worked us hard. They never looked like scoring but unfortunately for us it has finished 2-2 and that\u2019s hard to take.\u201d\nImpetus\nThe Lilywhites were comfortable when Griffin doubled his and his side\u2019s advantage just past the hour mark. However, Rovers were back in it on 79 minutes when Peter Cherrie punched only as far as ex-teammate Turner who fired to an empty net from 25-yards. And Foster was particularly disappointed with how that goal was conceded. \u201cI don\u2019t think my \u2018keeper should have come for it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe did it against Drogheda and didn\u2019t get there. Tonight, he got there, but if you let your centre-half deal with it, even if the centre-half doesn\u2019t win the header, their player isn\u2019t going to score. So, yes, I\u2019m hugely disappointed with that because then that gives them the impetus to go and throw bodies in the box. They put both centre-halves up and unfortunately it led to the equaliser.\nProud\n\u201cI thought we had done enough,\u201d he added, as the equaliser came with just over 90 seconds left on the clock. \u201cWe defended manfully; we won headers, we won second balls, we cleared lines. Just, unfortunately, we have been hit with a sucker-punch right in the last minute. But we have been fabulous tonight. We\u2019re all disappointed with a point at Shamrock Rovers. The level of performance tonight was superb. We should have been 2-0 up before we first scored. We created chance after chance, we passed them to death and we made them look like the away team. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the players \u2013 we were excellent tonight.\u201d Beforehand, most Dundalk fans would have taken a point. But asked if he felt it was two thrown away, Foster said: \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s two dropped \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say we threw it away.\nGriff praise\n\u201cThe game is not over until it\u2019s over,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they deserved anything out of the game, I\u2019ll certainly say that. I thought my players were fabulous.\u201d Commenting on the performance of two-goal Griffin, the Liverpool-born boss was delighted with how he finished his chances and troubled Rovers captain Dan Murray and his replacement Craig Sives. \u201cHe took his goals very, very well,\u201d Ian said. \u201cHe was a constant threat. They took off a centre-half because he couldn\u2019t deal with him, and the fella they brought on couldn\u2019t deal with him either. I\u2019m delighted for Mark. His work rate and his energy are excellent and he\u2019s a constant threat in and around the box. He took his goals very well and he could have been on the end of one or two more chances as well.\u201d\nPerformances\nThe draw ended a run of three straight league defeats for the Lilywhites. However, last week\u2019s display against Saint Patrick's Athletic was arguably their best home performance of the season while they produced their best away showing of the year in Tallaght. \u201cProbably, yeah,\u201d Foster agreed, \u201cand unfortunately we\u2019ve only got one point out of the two games. But if we keep playing with that level of performance then we\u2019ll win more games than we lose. Friday (at home to Galway United) is massive and I\u2019ve said that to the players. If they approach it with the same mentality, same energy, same work rate and same passing ability then we\u2019ll win the game. If we go back to the Drogheda scenario then we\u2019ll find it difficult. But our level of performance over the last two games has been wonderful.\u201d\nDFC Latest NewsTONIGHT!

Acer on Wednesday in a statement\nsaid that it has no plans to phase out netbooks as it increases its focus on tablets.\nThe company also said that it does not foresee tablets based on Sandy Bridge processors,\ncontrary to comments made earlier this week by an Acer sales manager in Taiwan.\nLu Bing-hsian earlier this week told the IDG News Service that Acer would begin\nselling new tablet PCs in the first half of this year as it gradually phases out\nnetbooks and that tablets would come with processors based on Intel's Sandy Bridge\nmicroarchitecture. \"For the moment it is not foreseen yet ... devices based\non Sandy Bridge,\" Acer said. Acer said the range of devices available to\nusers is expanding and that tablets \"will find their space next to netbooks\nand notebooks, without taking over.\" Acer in November announced new tablets\nwith 5-inch, 7-inch and 10-inch screens running on Google's Android operating system, which were also shown at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. The company\nalso showed a tablet with a 10-inch screen running Windows 7\n", "index": [[1669, 1676], [1774, 1777], [1787, 1791], [1819, 1827], [1921, 1923], [1925, 1928], [1930, 1939], [1944, 1953], [1966, 1977], [1979, 1985], [1990, 2000], [2002, 2006], [2051, 2055], [2234, 2246], [2309, 2313], [2331, 2337], [2380, 2396], [2402, 2406], [2562, 2567], [2570, 2582], [2662, 2674], [2677, 2681], [2688, 2692], [2845, 2849], [2935, 2941], [2944, 2968], [3006, 3031], [3096, 3105]], "wikipedia_ids": [52742, 15292, 216454, 378213, 21347024, 40379651, 220355, 19006979, 13481318, 8841749, 13111239, 397169, 397169, 7190463, 397169, 25734, 846558, 397169, 14617, 7190463, 7190463, 397169, 397169, 397169, 1092923, 12610483, 273555, 326123], "wikipedia_titles": ["Desktop computer", "Ink", "IPAQ", "Scanners", "Hewlett-Packard", "IBM", "Vaio", "Mac (computer)", "Palm Centro", "IPhone", "IPod Touch", "Acer Inc.", "Acer Inc.", "Sandy Bridge", "Acer Inc.", "Taiwan", "International Data Group", "Acer Inc.", "Intel", "Sandy Bridge", "Sandy Bridge", "Acer Inc.", "Acer Inc.", "Acer Inc.", "Google", "Android (operating system)", "Consumer Electronics Show", "Windows 7"]}

It's then that Max meets Charlie's brother, Vernon (Kyle MacLachlan), and sister-i\nn-law.\nThe latter, as it turns out, is Karen.\nDespite ONE NIGHT STAND's three-movement development, the film is built around oppositions and a number of ironic contrasts.\nMax's pairing with Karen is conveyed in sequences full of silently exchanged, knowing glances and freeze-framed sensuality, bless\ned by a passionate Beethoven string quartet and heady fusion soundtrack; his life with Mimi is characterized by unthinking pop music (in a particuarly telling movement, a pop song with a pounding bass beat bursts out the moment Max's plane lands in the LA airport, stamping out the breathless jazzy riffs of the night before), empty social gatherings peopled by non-soulful Advertising People and dictatorial sex.\nParallels are also of course drawn between New York (Karen) and LA (Mimi).\nIt might all be\njust a little too obvious (how's this for a meaningful comparison: the tryst takes place on the night of the fiftieth anniversary of the UN), but the casting of characters as Types in ONE NIGHT STAND ironically allows Figgis to concentrate on the way he\ntells the story, and that has always been one of the most interesting things about a Figgis film.\nThe heart of ONE NIGHT STAND, and its obvious center, is Charlie.\nAgain, of course, with the strange coincidences.\nRobert Downey Jr. is beautiful and saddening as the diminishing, wise Charlie, and it's hard not to think of his real-life problems with d\nrug addiction when you watch him.\nAnother aspect that gives you a peculiar feeling is the visual similarity between the Snipes-Kinski coupling and that of Cage and Shue in LEAVING LAS VEGAS.\nBoth Natassha Kinski and Elizabeth Shue have the same purity o\nf profile and flaxen hair (it probably has to do with lighting), and the scene where Kinski sits atop Snipes in ecstasy inevitably recalls its more poignant parallel in LEAVING LAS VEGAS.\nThe rich (inter)textuality and dense atmostphere of ONE NIGHT STAND make up for what would probably be, according to classic Hollywood conventions, poorly (or not clearly) motivated characters,\nand also for Figgis' way of leaving out standard Hollywood m\noments and required information from his narratives.\nCharlie's death is an example.\nIt goes completely unshown, but yet is an important event because it eventually unites the menage a quatre in more ways than one.\nOverall, ONE NIGHT STAND is delightful, intelligent, and strange.\nStrange in the way movies that don't tell you everything at their ending are strange, and not strange like Mimi from the Drew Carey show.\nA lot of this has to do with the wonderful perfor\nmances given by all the lead characters.\nKinski -- how old is this women?! -- does a good job of being both winsome and mystifying (winstifying?) at the same time, while Wen and Snipes are good at winning both our empathy and dislike.\nPost-affair Max, f\nor example, is a combination of obnoxiousness and anger that can be somewhat distancing, and because the movie seems to be told from his perspective, it isn't always easy to understand what he's going through.\nOverwhelmingly shunned by American audiences, ONE NIGHT STAND is a pleasant shelter from current blockbuster offerings, whether they be the stultifyingly banal I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, or the boring TITANIC\n", "index": [[499, 505], [725, 740], [897, 912], [1001, 1014], [1109, 1122], [1181, 1189], [1203, 1205], [1356, 1358], [1702, 1710], [1732, 1745], [1747, 1749], [1857, 1861], [1962, 1977], [2047, 2062], [2313, 2322], [2547, 2557], [2751, 2759], [2772, 2774], [2936, 2938], [2983, 2998], [3164, 3179], [3266, 3283], [3560, 3564], [3569, 3573], [3577, 3594], [3621, 3635], [3761, 3767], [3828, 3845], [3899, 3914], [3972, 3981], [4090, 4099], [4325, 4340], [4503, 4513], [4611, 4617], [4748, 4754], [5060, 5068], [5080, 5095], [5241, 5248]], "wikipedia_ids": [528673, 5209312, 5209312, 856360, 528673, 645042, 18130, 18130, 645042, 171045, 1002441, 5069516, 16757, 5209312, 17914, 18131, 645042, 18130, 31769, 5209312, 5209312, 171045, 21111, 508014, 54160, 508014, 528673, 54160, 5209312, 84485, 84485, 5209312, 18842230, 211233, 528673, 3434750, 5209312, 52371], "wikipedia_titles": ["Wesley Snipes", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "Joe Eszterhas", "Wesley Snipes", "New York City", "Louisiana", "Louisiana", "New York City", "Robert Downey Jr.", "Jim Ross", "HIV/AIDS", "Kyle MacLachlan", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "Ludwig van Beethoven", "Los Angeles International Airport", "New York City", "Louisiana", "United Nations", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "Robert Downey Jr.", "Nicolas Cage", "Elisabeth Shue", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Elisabeth Shue", "Wesley Snipes", "Leaving Las Vegas", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "Hollywood", "Hollywood", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "Drew Carey", "Klaus Kinski", "Wesley Snipes", "United States", "One Night Stand (1997 film)", "Titanic (1997 film)"]}

One walks slowly over bare tarmac with the wavy mirage traces of jet fuel\nevaporating from the baked runway.\nYour eyes must squint to distinguish actual form from hallucination in the gaseous blur.\nThe mugginess is\npalpable and steams up from the bayou to create a state of perpetual humidity, you strain to wipe away the sweat dripping from your brow on the balmy\nLouisiana day.\na city under pressure of heat and moisture,\nSteam condenses on your tongue as you try to speak, but because you are walking quickly you think again and feel better in the short term just to\nshield your nose and hold your breath as the stench of rotting waste reaches you. That which was cast off by mortal flesh, and that once consumed by\nhuman mutely decay, lay in steaming piles and reek in the clammy gulf coast breeze;\nthe waste having not been removed for over two weeks.\na city under pressure of decomposition,\nThe concourse which once facilitated the bustle of life in the hyper-modernist fast lane was used during the last fortnight as a triage for sorting\nout the ill and as a morgue for the dead. Sprawling on strands of cots strung out along the terminal's vast expanse of grimy marble floor and close\ncropped carpet lay the injured and poor black folk of the 9th ward and St Bernard's Parish, making themselves as comfortable as they could in front of\nthe vacant ticket counters, gated newspaper stands, empty coffee joints and miscellaneous jazz paraphernalia.\nTransformed from a place which housed mere travelers into a hall of the wholly dispossessed is Louis Armstrong International Airport; but what else would\none expect? The child of a New Orleans prostitute, Satchmo was already abandoned and then arrested at the age of six.\nWhat else would one expect from history in the deep South, only now being staged within the facade of an international airport?\nThe airport, that\nbastion of globalization which makes planetary culture possible now houses the distraught and dispossessed, the discontented and dying of America's\n3rd\nworld; hermetically sealed within its own environs.\na city under pressure of history,\nBut there are no commercial flights taking off today, just Blackhawk helicopters and C-130s involved in rescue and reconstruction. The flow of\ncommerce has been halted, preempted by 120 mph winds and the flood. The forces of the market which once built this airport reduced to a trickle, this\nport city and hub of world commerce now just the glean in the eye of Haliburton or the Shaw Group contemplating the future potential of capital\nventures and returns at more than twenty percent.\na city at the mercy of military industrial carpetbaggers,\nOne walks on to meet the air traffic control manager whose disheveled tower is now in\ndisarray and overflowing with controllers sleeping on air\nmattresses in front of sophisticated radar arrays and advanced navigation systems. The technology which made this airport possible is temporarily out\nof service and gathering dust.\nThe wide cherry table tops of conference rooms where local procedures for approach control and the divvying up of\nairspace were once decided now served as the platform to place k rations stale coffee and half eaten donuts.\nratiocination and technology at the mercy of a southern tempest,\nAll the technology in the world could not put a bandage on the damage done by the storm and flood to get operations back to normal sooner. The warm\ngulf currents which fed Katrina were only heated further by the carbon waste spewed from oil refineries and industry along the coast. Already no match\nfor a category four hurricane, the dredging of swamps by oil companies allowed salt water to seep back into the once fertile wetlands which now yield\nup more than 100 acres a day to the sea. The levees of the mighty river denied needed silt to restore the earth under this grand old city which\nallowed it to nestle safely between the Mississippi and Pontchartrain.\nratiocination and technology at the mercy of blow-back,\nThose bound in the\ncyclic of history of domination, of the eternal recurrence of the underclass,\nare those most effected, but what else would one\nexpect, here in the deep South? where burnt crosses still smolder in the charcoal heart of Dixie,\nand can suddenly violently alight\nin an inferno;\ninto which we begin our descent from the French Quarter. This is a city which could just as easily burn while being martyred for the sins of a nation,\nbut this is the city in the time of flood.\nHere now reside those forced to the fringes of our society, those who live below sea level, the ones who do not partake of the prosperity of this\nPort economy; of mid-western grain harvest barges, trans-oceanic container ships, and Gulf oil rigs. These folks are too far removed from the\nmainstream to be concerned with the storm's effect on falling world markets sparked by the rising price of gasoline, because they had no vehicles to\nevacuate the area in the first place. They do however, still need food, and the shopkeepers have all left for higher ground.\nAlready the 200 billion dollar reconstruction being planned has passed legislation and funnels funds through the lobbyist and technocrat directly\ninto the coffers of the good ol' boys\nand multi-nationals. Yet, the same legislation eliminated the Davis-Bacon Act and the minimum wage of the\nconstruction laborer. But what else would one expect in a state next to the president's own?\nTo be rebuilt yet again, but now upon the backs of\ndescendent's of slaves of the Americas both North and South. But now a tax cut and a debit card with a two thousand dollar limit will have to serve in\nplace of forty acres and a mule.\ncarpetbaggers conspiring with technology,\nThose who own the technology and resources to begin construction, who are the masters of calculating the market forces, who have the ear of the\nvice president will come out ahead in this disaster. Old low lying neighborhoods will be bulldozed and then gentrified, those shining glass and steel\nstructures will gleam for a new class of entrepreneurs who will profit from the Reconstruction. New infra-structure will replace the rotting old\nwooden front porches of houses built during the Depression. Law and order will be haphazardly restored. The airport will have its waste removed, the\nconcourses cleared of patients, the military will depart its taxiways, it will be retooled and its technology will reanimate the\nbayou economy to\nonce again fuel the oil gluttony of the global village, even as the corps of engineers still struggle to halt the progress of the encroaching\nwetlands.\ntechnology along with equality and justice sinking slowly in the ratiocination of Cajun swamp land\n--------------------\nRichard Carlson is a writer/musician and the president of Pacific Weather Inc, a firm which monitors meteorological information at airports throughout the United States.

Neighboring West Virginia communities are already seeing benefits from development of the Hatfield and McCoy Trail System, which attracts thousands of tourists and generates millions in revenue each year. This photo was taken during the 2011 Trailfest in Gilbert, W.Va.\nPIKEVILLE \u2013 Counties throughout eastern Kentucky plan to boost the economy by developing and promoting adventure tourism activities.\nBig Sandy Area Development Director Sandy Runyon, who has worked with local leaders to establish trail systems in eastern Kentucky for a number of years, reports that officials in Breathitt, Clay, Knott, Leslie, Bell, Letcher, Perry, Owsley and Harlan counties have worked together for quite some time to develop a trail system that would attract ATV riders, horse enthusiasts, hikers and others into eastern Kentucky.\nRunyon explained that those counties have entered into an interlocal agreement regarding the trail system, with the understanding that each county is responsible for trail development and maintenance in their counties. Officials in these counties also agree that counties would assist each other with maintenance or other issues on neighboring properties, with the understanding that counties won't be billed for that service and with goal of eventually connecting all trails together in one large system.\nThe Pike County Fiscal Court is the first of several Big Sandy area counties to become a part of the initiative by passing a resolution to join the multi-county effort during a Nov. 1 meeting. Although Pike county officials talked about developing a trail system to mimic the successful Hatfield-McCoy ATV Trail system in West Virginia, Runyon believes the interlocal agreement, once it is finalized, will encompass all types of trails and trail-based activities.\nThe first step is for Fiscal Courts in those counties to pass a resolution stating the county's intent on participating. Thereafter, county attorneys will hash out a finalized interlocal agreement that suits the needs of all counties. The Big Sandy ADD is currently preparing resolutions for other Big Sandy counties.\n\u201cI'm not sure how many counties will sign on,\u201d Runyon said. \u201cBut we know that Pike, Floyd, Magoffin and Martin counties are interested and we expect that Johnson County will also be interested. Our goal is to have any kind of agreement they enter into to include all trails.\u201d\nOnce the interlocal agreement between the counties is finalized, Runyon said it is likely that individual counties will be responsible for obtaining land-use permits from residents, which could be a \u201chuge endeavor\u201d in counties like Pike County, where officials have identified 200 property owners along one potential trail route.\nRunyon said the biggest issue in connecting eastern Kentucky trails is the liability that property owners face when they allow the public to come onto their property.\nThere has been some effort at the state level to pass legislation to ease the property liability burden, but the state's tort law, allowing people to sue for various reasons, may prevent further success of that effort.\nOne bill passed the House last year, but it died without a vote in the Senate.\nRunyon said the laws enacted by the legislature show progress.\n\u201cI do think there is a way around all of this if everybody can work together, and they truly do work together, and try to add all the needs of everybody involved,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we can make some progress.\u201d\nAreas like Harlan, Bell, Knott Leslie and Knott counties found ways around the liability issues and are able to market trails and host large-scale trail events because a large corporate landowner or private landowners with large, usable tracks of property provided a long-term lease to the county.\n\u201cBell County is the new kid on the block,\u201d Runyon said. \u201cThere was a company there that leased 7,600 acres to the county. They held an ATV event there three weeks ago that attracted 3,000 riders. So, it's possible to do this.\u201d\nRunyon said the local residents contacted by the Big Sandy ADD have reported that they are excited about the potential.\n\u201cThe only resistance we see is the unknown,\u201d she said. \u201cIf every county develops a block of property and show the locals that it will work, that people will come in here to ride these trails and there is economic benefit to that, then I think local landowners will want to get involved.\u201d\nShe is asking all counties to assess properties that might be available for trail development.\nThe multi-county coalition will make the region more eligible to receive multi-county coal severance tax funds and grant funding for trail development projects, Runyon explained.\n\u201cWe truly believe here that tourism will be an economic development engine,\u201d Runyon said. \u201cIt won't be the only engine, but it will be a major economic tool for this region.\u201d\nShare and Enjoy:\nAuthor: admin Categories: Community News, Uncategorized Tags:\nComments are closed.\nObituaries\nCounty receives flood buyout money\nRSS feed\nGoogle\nYoudao\nXian Guo\nZhua Xia\nMy Yahoo!\nnewsgator\nBloglines\niNezha\nThe Medical Leader on Facebook\nArchives\nJanuary 2012\nDecember 2011\nNovember 2011\nOctober 2011\nJuly 2011\nJune 2011\nMay 2011\nApril 2011\nMarch 2011\nFebruary 2011\nJanuary 2011\nDecember 2010\nNovember 2010\nOctober 2010\nSeptember 2010\nAugust 2010\nJuly 2010\nMay 2010\nApril 2010\nMarch 2010\nFebruary 2010\nJanuary 2010\nDecember 2009\nNovember 2009\nOctober 2009\nAugust 2009\nMay 2009\nSearch for:\nArchives\nJanuary 2012\nDecember 2011\nNovember 2011\nOctober 2011\nJuly 2011\nJune 2011\nMay 2011\nApril 2011\nMarch 2011\nFebruary 2011\nJanuary 2011\nDecember 2010\nNovember 2010\nOctober 2010\nSeptember 2010\nAugust 2010\nJuly 2010\nMay 2010\nApril 2010\nMarch 2010\nFebruary 2010\nJanuary 2010\nDecember 2009\nNovember 2009\nOctober 2009\nAugust 2009\nMay 2009\nMeta\nLog in\npowered bySocialbar\nTop\nWordPress\nCopyright \u00a9 2009-2012 The Medical Leader\nTheme by mg12.

You feel that you want to continue that tradition that they have already established.\u201dHall was a part of the green and white coaching staff for 15 seasons, including eight as defensive co-ordinator. He helped the Riders win the Grey Cup in 2007.Hall left Saskatchewan in 2009 to become head coach and defensive co-ordinator of the Edmonton Eskimos. He was embraced by Edmonton fans and players alike for his ready grin and relentless optimism, but that wasn't enough to offset a losing record.He was fired by the Eskimos in November after Edmonton finished with a 7-11 record last season and missed the playoffs.It was a learning experience.\u201cI think it's changed you, but I don't know if it changed me because I've been the head coach. I think it's just the last two years of experience, as far as the things that I've endured, that makes you either bitter or makes you better. And I always think that your experiences make you a better person,\u201d said Hall.\u201cI like to think that I'm better today than I was yesterday.\u201dBefore moving into coaching, Hall spent nine years playing in the CFL, including four seasons with the Roughriders from 1988 to 1991. He was a key member of the Roughriders' 1989 Grey Cup championship team.Hall said he doesn't think going from a head coach position to defensive co-ordinator is a step backwards.\u201cI've always looked at it as just to have the opportunity to do something that you enjoy doing and that's coaching,\u201d he said.\u201cWhether it's being a position coach, whether it's being a co-ordinator or whether it's being a head coach, I get the luxury of doing something that I enjoy doing. It doesn't matter what my role is, but to be able to coach I think that's a lot of fun.\u201dRiders GM Brendan Taman said Hall's record speaks for itself.\u201cHe's pretty successful wherever he's been and as a defensive coach, whenever teams I've (been with) played against him, it was tough. He's a good coach and obviously was in the search for the head coaching job so we think a lot of him,\u201d said Taman.The head coaching job in Saskatchewan opened up in December when Ken Miller announced he would be stepping down to focus on his position as the Riders' vice-president of football operations.Last month, the Riders handed the reins to Greg Marshall.Marshall started coaching in the CFL in 1994 in Saskatchewan. He was the team's defensive line coach for two seasons before adding the title of defensive co-ordinator. Marshall left the Riders in 1999 for other coaching positions and was most recently the Hamilton Tiger-Cats' defensive co-ordinator for the past two seasons.Hall, who worked with Marshall in Saskatchewan, said they have a good relationship.\u201cEver since we departed in 2000, we've always had the desire to work together again,\u201d said Hall.\u201cI know I'm very excited about it and he's very excited. You know it's interesting because we've been apart for so long, now to come back together and to see what we've learned.

Many areas will receive increased amounts of rain and snow over the course of a year; some areas will receive less. But scientists expect that, all across the country, the rainstorms and snowstorms that do occur will be more intense \u2013 increasing the risk of flooding and other impacts.\nIn this report, we evaluate trends in the frequency of storms with extreme levels of rainfall or snowfall across the contiguous United States over the last 60 years. We analyze daily precipitation records spanning from 1948 through 2006 at more\u00a0than 3,000 weather stations in 48 states. We then examine patterns in the timing of heavy precipitation relative to the local climate at each weather station.\nWe find that storms with extreme amounts of rain or snowfall are happening more often across most of America, consistent with the predicted impact of global warming.\nScientists expect global warming to increase the frequency of heavy precipitation.\nAs the earth warms, temperate regions of North America will face a growing risk of storms with extreme levels of rain or snowfall.\nGlobal warming increases the intensity of precipitation in two key ways. First, by increasing the temperature of the land and the oceans, global warming causes water to evaporate faster. Second, by increasing air temperature, global warming enables the atmosphere to hold more water vapor. These factors combine to make clouds richer with moisture, making heavy downpours or snowstorms more likely.\nThe consequences of increasingly intense rainstorms may include flooding, crop damage, pollution of waterways with runoff, erosion, and other environmental and economic damage. During the 20th century, floods caused more property damage and loss of life than any other natural disaster in the United States.\nAn increase in the number of downpours does not necessarily mean more water will be available.\nScientists expect that extreme downpours will punctuate longer periods of relative dryness, increasing the risk of drought. In the Southwest, for example, total annual precipitation is projected to decline \u2013 amplifying the impact of periods of little rainfall between heavy storms.\nEven in the rest of the country, where total annual precipitation is expected to increase, more of that precipitation will fall in heavy rainstorms or snowstorms, paradoxically increasing the potential for drought.\nAs temperatures rise, precipitation will become increasingly likely to fall as rain rather than snow, increasing runoff and likely reducing water supplies in areas dependent on snowpack.\nWeather records show that storms with extreme precipitation have become more frequent over the last 60 years.\nConsistent with the predicted impacts of global warming, we found that storms with extreme precipitation have increased in frequency by 24 percent across the continental United States since 1948. (According to a statistical analysis of the data, with 95 percent confidence, the increase has been between 22 and 26 percent.)\nNew England and the Mid-Atlantic experienced the largest increase in extreme precipitation frequency.\nNew England and the Mid-Atlantic saw storms with extreme precipitation levels increase in frequency by 61 percent and 42 percent, respectively. At the state level, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York and Louisiana all saw extreme precipitation events increase in frequency by more than 50 percent.\nIn the contiguous United States, 40 states experienced a statistically significant trend toward increasingly frequent storms with extreme precipitation. Only one state (Oregon) showed a statistically significant decline in frequency of storms with extreme precipitation. (See Figure ES-1.)\nSee the report appendices on page 35 for a full list of results by region, state and metropolitan area.\nThese findings are consistent with previous studies of extreme precipitation patterns, both in the United States and across the globe.\nClimate divisions covering more than half of the land area of the United States show a statistically significant trend toward more frequent storms with extreme precipitation.\nWe also looked at the trend in frequency of storms with extreme precipitation within climate divisions, which are boundaries used by climatologists since the 1950s to aggregate weather observations. Figure ES-2 presents these trends, showing that\u00a0the largest increases occurred across New England, New York, much of the Great Lakes area, the upper Midwest, plus Louisiana, New Mexico, northern Washington and southern California.\nClimate regions covering more than half of the surface area of the contiguous United States show a statistically significant increase in the frequency of storms with extreme precipitation levels.\nIn contrast, the data show statistically significant decreases in extreme precipitation frequency for climate regions covering only 4 percent of the area of the United States. (Oregon, the northwestern corner of North Dakota, central Arkansas, the southern tip of Lake Michigan, and northern Florida.)\nThese findings are consistent with previous studies of extreme precipitation patterns, both in the United States and across the globe. For example:\nScientists have observed warmer weather, higher atmospheric moisture content, increased formation of storm clouds, and an increase in thunderstorm activity over the contiguous United States in recent decades.\nIn 1999, researchers at the Illinois State Water Survey and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) found that storms with extreme precipitation became more frequent by about 3 percent per decade from 1931 to 1996. Our findings are consistent with this result.\nIn 2004, scientists at NCDC concluded that most of the observed increase in storms with heavy and very heavy precipitation levels since the early 1900s had occurred in the last three decades. In other words, they found that the change in extreme precipitation frequency is unusual and relatively recent.\nMoreover, NCDC found that extremely heavy storms are increasing in frequency more rapidly than very heavy storms \u2013 which in turn are increasing in frequency more rapidly than heavy storms.\nThe severity of the trend toward more intense downpours in the future depends upon our emissions of the pollution that drives global warming.\nClimate models predict that the trend toward increasingly frequent storms with heavy precipitation will intensify in the future. Some amount of change is inevitable given the global warming emissions humans have already created. However, we still have the ability to prevent the worst-case scenarios.\nBy halting the increase in total US global warming emissions now and reducing emissions by at least 80 percent by mid-century, we can limit the increase in major storm frequency \u2014 and thus reduce future risks of flooding and other serious consequences of extreme rainstorms.\nTo address global warming, America should limit emissions of global warming pollution, while improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy.\nTo protect future generations, the United States should adopt a mandatory cap on global warming pollution that reduces total US emissions by at least 15 to 20 percent by 2020 and by at least 80 percent by 2050.\nIf policymakers choose a cap-and-trade program to achieve this goal, it should include auctioning 100 percent of emission allowances, rather than giving allowances away to polluters. By auctioning allowances, we can reduce the cost of achieving emission reduction goals, making it more likely that America will succeed.\nThe United States should also adopt complementary policies to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of clean, renewable energy.\nHow We Obtained Our Results\nIn this report, we examine trends in the frequency of extreme precipitation across the contiguous United States from 1948 through 2006.

Since the magnetic poles do not lie in the same place on\nthe earth's globe as the true north and south poles, a compass needle\nwill usually not point directly at the geographic pole. The deviation\ndepends on where the compass is in relation to the magnetic pole\nas well as local geomagnetic conditions. Knowing this \"magnetic\nvariation\" was of crucial importance to navigators trying to\navoid being lost at sea. It was of particular concern to those plying\nthe North Atlantic. Near the equator, variation might only be a\ndegree or so, but in northern waters, it can vary up to 90\u00b0.\nNear Greenland, navigators could conceivably be sailing west when\nthey thought they were sailing north.\nBorough therefore\nput into a simple instrument all the tools that the navigator needed\nto find and map variation at any point on the globe. This\nwoodcut reduces a complex exercise in terrestrial geomagnetic and\nspherical geometry to a simple image of a simple instrument made\nup of simple and known commodities: compass and sundial. Designed\nfor workaday purposes and not purporting to reveal any hidden truths\nof the earth or heavens, the instrument of variation allowed English\nsailors to map the North Atlantic. The timeliness of the book and\nthe instrument it explained are underscored by recalling that the\nEnglish only began seriously contemplating overseas exploration\nand colonies in the 1570s (Drake returned from his circumnavigation\nin 1578) and her first colony was (unsuccessfully) planted on Roanoke\nin 1584. Although described by Borough\u2014the more able mathematician\u2014the\ninstrument was apparently invested with great meaning for Robert Norman (fl. 1590), who took the trouble to have his initials placed\nat the foot of the shadow line, identifying this invention and this\nembodied knowledge as his own.\nThe instrument worked\nas follows: Placing the instrument level and plumb on a stool and\naligning the shadow from the cord on the NS line of the compass\ndial, the navigator noted the position of the needle at two times\nin the day when the sun was at equal elevations above the horizon\u2014that\nis, at equal times on either side of local noon. Half the difference\nin the absolute value of these two needle positions gave the local\nmagnetic variation since magnetic north is not in quite the same\ndirection as true north (the north magnetic pole lies at about 77\u00b0\nN lat., 45\u00b0 W long.). So, for example, at 8 AM the needle might\npoint 48\u00b0E and at 4pm point 45\u00b0W; the local magnetic variation\nwould then be 1.5\u00b0E ([48\u00b0-45\u00b0]/2) at that point on the\nglobe. The next time any ship came to the area, then, it would be\nable to compensate for that 1.5\u00b0 and sail towards its destination\nreliably. One limitation of this instrument, however, was that to\ndetermine the most accurate declinations, the readings ought to\nhave been taken as far apart in the day as possible, but that meant\nthe mariner had to stay put for most or all of that day, not only\na difficult task on the ocean, but also quite inefficient in terms\nof reaching one's destination. Ultimately, though, this instrument\nand many more like it defined the mathematical arts for late-sixteenth-century\nEnglishmen and the world they sought to create.\nSteven A.\nWalton\nMichigan Technological University\nSuggested Reading\nBarlow, William.

In a three-day period, Barmar district near Pakistan received 22.7 inches (57.7 cm) of rain\u2014more than double its annual average. Over 800,000 in this region alone have been affected by the floods.\nAssam\nThis northeast Indian state forms a large part of the drainage system for the massive Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, which in flood stage often cut villages off from transportation, electricity and phone communication for weeks.\n\u201cNormal life in these areas has been greatly affected,\u201d said a GFA field correspondent, who reported that hundreds of pastors and church members suffered heavy damage and property loss. \u201cWe are struggling to recover.\u201d\nGujarat\nWater covered up to half of Surat, Gujarat\u2019s \u201cDiamond City,\u201d and affected an estimated 3.2 million people as a result of the heavy rains that fell in August. Much of the state is still under the threat of flooding, with several rivers at or above flood stage.\nMaharashtra\nFlash floods in this state swept away sections of railway line, submerged bridges and closed major highways. Low-lying areas in cities such as Nagpur and Mumbai were also affected, especially bringing suffering to the slum-dwellers and others with already inadequate shelter. Some homes, saturated with water, have collapsed, killing the residents inside.\nAndhra Pradesh\nThe consequences of the heavy rainfall severely impacted residents in thousands of villages in this state. With water levels in reservoirs rising dangerously, officials were forced to release millions of gallons of water into the already flooded rivers. Then, a tropical depression that formed in the Bay of Bengal caused more heavy rainfall for four straight days.\nTwo Koya tribal villages were completely wiped out when the Sabari and Seeleru Rivers rose 12 feet above their banks and swept through the communities. Villagers ran for a nearby hill as the rivers washed away their belongings and completely destroyed all 260 mud-and-bamboo homes. They waited for two days, without food or water, before aid arrived.\nMadhya Pradesh\nSome villagers were stranded after floods cut them off from roads and nearby towns. The city of Bhopal experienced rainfall of 35.4 inches (90 cm) in just one night, breaking a record of 30.31 inches (77 cm) set in 1973. A girl was killed and six people injured when a tree fell on the group due to the heavy rains.\nChhattisgarh\nWidespread rainfall has pounded the state and flood waters have overflowed at least one dam, causing further flooding downstream. In one district, 60 houses were completely isolated by the waters.\nOrissa\nThe threat of more rain came from the same tropical depression affecting Andhra Pradesh, and fishermen were cautioned to remain at home due to dangerously rough seas. Several rivers overflowed their banks and inundated large areas, and one city recorded rainfall of 6.7 inches (17 cm) in a 24-hour period.\nJammu & Kashmir\nA mountainous state, Jammu & Kashmir has not only experienced its share of floods, but landslides as well. As a result, residents faced transportation problems with stretches of highway either being under water, blocked or caved in. Twenty deaths were reported in the state, primarily from houses collapsing, and thousands of other homes were damaged.\nMonsoon Predictable? To a Point\nThe word \u201cmonsoon\u201d comes from an Arabic word meaning \u201cseason,\u201d and was first used in the 16th century by Portuguese and Dutch traders sailing the spice route to India. It refers to the seasonal wind pattern change that occurs over the Subcontinent: First, the land heats up during the first months of the year; then, as the hot air rises, moist air from the Indian Ocean blows in from the southwest to take its place, bringing heavy rainfall.\nRains from the yearly Southwest Monsoon generally begin in southern India around June 1 and spread northwest through June and July. The rains start to abate from the northwest in September and retreat to the southeast, leaving the Subcontinent around the middle of October. But though the arrival and departure of the monsoon season can be forecast relatively accurately, what is not predictable each year is the intensity of the rainfall.\nThis has been the case for the 2006 monsoon, which has caused the loss of more than 2,000 lives and the displacement of millions all across the nation of India\n", "index": [[1821, 1826], [1928, 1933], [2030, 2045], [2121, 2138], [2228, 2247], [2396, 2399], [2954, 2961], [2977, 2985], [3008, 3023], [3049, 3058], [3070, 3075], [3095, 3104], [3249, 3257], [3423, 3429], [3494, 3511], [3708, 3711], [3899, 3904], [3906, 3913], [4286, 4292], [4297, 4303], [4815, 4828], [5342, 5348], [5852, 5866], [6122, 6137], [6518, 6524], [6590, 6600], [6605, 6610], [6646, 6651], [6843, 6855], [6950, 6967], [6996, 7001], [7159, 7171], [7522, 7527]], "wikipedia_ids": [14533, 14533, 2282040, 57630, 20611562, 19344654, 53707, 408677, 62209600, 16880, 14533, 26291, 23235, 20611562, 183522, 2282040, 226715, 53707, 460979, 19189, 47892, 47946, 2377, 62209600, 803, 23033, 21148, 14533, 14580, 57630, 14533, 20611562, 14533], "wikipedia_titles": ["India", "India", "Gospel for Asia", "Monsoon", "Indian subcontinent", "BBC", "Gujarat", "Nagaland", "Jammu and Kashmir", "Karnataka", "India", "Rajasthan", "Pakistan", "Indian subcontinent", "Brahmaputra River", "Gospel for Asia", "Surat", "Gujarat", "Nagpur", "Mumbai", "Bay of Bengal", "Bhopal", "Andhra Pradesh", "Jammu and Kashmir", "Arabic", "Portugal", "Netherlands", "India", "Indian Ocean", "Monsoon", "India", "Indian subcontinent", "India"]}

Now we have the latest trend in the market which is the mini-notebook. It is more widely known as netbook. It is small with only 13 inches measurement for its screen. Various major computer companies are having these cool devices on sale. If you are planning to get one, it is better to properly understand its functions in order to know that this is what exactly will meet your needs. Here will help you to make up your mind whether to purchase one or not.\nFirst of all, let us see the good sides of the mini-notebook functions. It is smaller and lighter in comparison to other general laptops or notebooks. It is like a standard normal book which could be easily carried with the hand. Since it is so portable, an individual could bring it to wherever he or she wants to travel to. It could be light in the bag and there more spaces in the bag where other things could also be stuffed in. Ladies will especially appreciate this as she may have keys, make-up things, tissues, mobile phone and water bottle to carry together. With conventional notebook, one may have to carry a separate bag just for the device. Another advantage is that it does function fully as any computer. It has all the main operating system and applications, ports for connections, Wi-Fi, webcam, CD-ROM or burner and functional keyboard. Apart from that, the price and cost is low and affordable. Thenetbook would not cost much higher than any ordinary laptop or notebook and it is inexpensive for anyone to purchase. Overall, this small device is for those who are always on the go for businesses in usages of e-mail and quick note-taking. It is also for students to carry for typing lecture notes rather than writing down.\nHere comes the downside of this small computer. Although it is fully functional, it has limitations. The processor plus the memory are lower in speed and it causes a file to be played slower. For example, a video may pause by itself and then continues playing. It may repeat the same over and over again. While downloading files, there may be complications too. The smaller screen and keyboard may pose a problem depending on different users. If you are planning to do major work with long hours, it is advise not to buy this type of computer as the battery life will not support longer hours like conventional laptop does.\nIn the end it is up to you whether to own a mini-notebook depending on what your usages are.\nAbout the Author: Stuart Michael\nAuthor recommends Tech-FAQ for more information on topics such as\nQWERTY\nand\nMini Notebook.

Aldosterone is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands to help regulate the salt and water balance in your body.\nAldactone also treats fluid retention (edema) in people with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or a kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome. This medication is also used to treat or prevent hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).\nAldactone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\nImportant information about Aldactone\nYou should not use Aldactone if you are allergic to spironolactone, or if you have kidney disease, high levels of potassium in your blood, or if you are unable to urinate. Do not use potassium supplements or other diuretics while you are taking Aldactone.\nBefore using Aldactone, tell your doctor if you have liver disease, or if you use a steroid or another diuretic.\nDrinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of Aldactone.\nAvoid a diet high in salt. Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make this medication less effective.\nDo not use salt substitutes or low-sodium milk products that contain potassium. These products could cause your potassium levels to get too high while you are taking Aldactone.\nAvoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather. Follow your doctor's instructions about the type and amount of liquids you should drink. In some cases, drinking too much liquid can be as unsafe as not drinking enough.\nIf you are being treated for high blood pressure, keep using Aldactone even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medication for the rest of your life.\nBefore taking Aldactone\nYou should not use Aldactone if you are allergic to spironolactone, or if you have:\nkidney disease, or if you are unable to urinate;\nhigh levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia); or\nif you are taking potassium supplements or other potassium-sparing diuretics such as Aldactazide, amiloride (Midamor, Moduretic), or triamterene (Dyrenium, Dyazide, Maxzide).\nTo make sure you can safely take Aldactone, tell your doctor if you have any of these other conditions:\nheart disease;\nliver disease; or\nif you are using a steroid, or another diuretic.\nFDA pregnancy category C. It is not known whether Aldactone will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using this medication. Spironolactone passes into breast milk and could cause harm to a nursing baby. Do not use this medication without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.See also: Aldactone pregnancy and breastfeeding warnings (in more detail)\nHow should I take Aldactone?\nTake Aldactone exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.\nTake each dose with a full glass of water.\nTo be sure Aldactone is not causing harmful effects, your blood will need to be tested often. Visit your doctor regularly.\nThis medication can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Aldactone. If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using Aldactone. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time. If you are being treated for high blood pressure, keep using this medication even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medication for the rest of your life.\nStore Aldactone at room temperature away from heat, light, and moisture.\nSee also: Aldactone dosage (in more detail)What happens if I miss a dose?\nTake the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.\nWhat happens if I overdose?\nSeek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.\nOverdose symptoms may include drowsiness, confusion, red skin rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nWhat should I avoid while taking Aldactone?\nDrinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of Aldactone. Do not use salt substitutes or low-sodium milk products that contain potassium. These products could cause your potassium levels to get too high while you are taking Aldactone.\nAvoid a diet high in salt. Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make this medication less effective.\nAldactone may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert.\nAvoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather.

Group, NBX Bikes and The NBX/Narragansett Beer Cycling Team\nWarwick, RI\nSunday, December 09, 2007\nSeries Finale:\nNBX Grand Prix, Warwick, RI\nVERGE New England Championship Cyclo-Cross Series\nPowers Pips Wells, Bessette Returns to Power\nWarwick, Rhode Island (December 9, 2007) The final event of the 2007 Verge New England Championship Cyclo-cross Series featured another nail-biter finish in the men's elite race and the return to form of 'cross legend Lyne Bessette.\nThe final race also crowned series winners in nine categories, including dominant -- and promising -- performances in the Under-19 juniors and Under-23 seniors.\nIn the Mens Elite, Jeremy Powers (Cyclocrossworld.com) got the holeshot and quickly opened a 12-second lead on Todd Wells (GT), who pleased the crowd by hopping the barriers near the course's central carousel building. Series leader Jesse Anthony (Jamis) and Tim Johnson\n(Cannondale-Leer-Cyclocrossworld.com) were close behind.\nAfter two laps, Wells bridged to Powers and the two traded attacks until Wells crashed and bent his derailleur on the last lap. Powers decided not to attack Wells until he went into the pit to take another bike, then he punched it to take about a five-second gap that Wells quickly closed.\nFrom there, it looked to be a repeat of Saturday's race, when Wells came around Anthony to nip him at the line. But this time, Wells attacked Powers about a kilometer from the finish and Powers had to close a small gap on the final straight to win by a hand's width.\n\"He got a little gap, maybe two bike lengths, coming into the last straight,\" Powers said. \"Maybe it was a little too much, but Todd hit a root kind of cock-eyed and then he went wide so I was able to close maybe one bike length and then I was just able to catch him at the end.\"\nIn the Womens Elite races, Bessette (Cyclocrossworld.com) returned to the series after missing the last two events due to illness and travel. She wasted no time producing the kind of performance that has helped her win the four previous series events she started.\n\"I had a good start, I felt snappy on the start,\" Bessette said at the finish. \"I went through the course gradually and after\nthe middle I opened more gas and I felt good; I tried to really push the speed in the corners.\"\nBehind her, in a breakthrough performance, Amy Wallace (Richard Sachs-RGM Watches) also got a snappy start and separated herself from the chasers. Wallace kept within 15 seconds of Bessette for about two laps, and held a steady pace to the end to turn in her best series finish to date.\n\"Today I was feeling good when I got up. I told my teammates, 'I can win today.' Then I saw Lyne was here and I said, \" ' I can definitely get second,'\" she said with a smile. \"The mental attitude helps so much.\"\nRebecca Wellons (Ridley), who came into Sunday's race in the series lead, and had to finish no worse than second behind Bessette to hold the lead. Unfortunately for Wellons, she got a poor start and finished sixth.\n\"I gave it everything my body had,\" said Wellons.\nVerge NECCS Series Results:\nElite Men: Wins at the Gloucester and Northampton races highlighted Anthony's series victory in his first year as an Elite. For Chris Jones (NERAC), the series was an accelerated class in cyclocross. In his first full season as a crosser, Jones won at Farmington, Conn., and finished the series in second. Cross legend Mark McCormack, who has won the series seven times, was on the podium again in his first season as a part-time racer.\nElite Women: Bessette dominated the series even while skipping two events. However, the story of the series was often the race for second. Wellons, Milkowski and Wallace all climbed onto the second spot on the podium this year, and all three are optimistic about taking the next step up in years to come. In the end Wellons'\nconsistency - she was second five times - overcame Milkowski's two victories to fill out the series podium.\nU23:\nJamey Driscoll (Fiordi-Frutta) was unbeaten in the U23\ncategory, but impressed more observers with his performance relative to the elite men. He finished seventh in the elite series and was fifth in the final event. Behind him, the race for second came down to the wire, with Jerome Townsend (Ridley) holding off a surging Nicholas Keough (Jittery Joes-Sonic)\nJunior U19/U15: Luke Keough (C.L.Noonan-Coast to Coast) - the reigning cyclocross national champion -\nand Gavin Mannion (Hot Tubes) - the reigning criterium national champion - battled all season in the U19 Junior category. While Mannion won the final event, Keough won the series, and both go into the national championships in Kansas City next weekend with high hopes for a second stars and stripes jersey. In the U15/Cub Juniors category Tommy Goguen (Minuteman Road Club) and Curtis White (CRBC) represented the future of American\n", "index": [[1386, 1393], [1395, 1407], [1604, 1617], [1799, 1812], [1891, 1901], [1903, 1905], [2028, 2033], [2039, 2050], [2124, 2129], [2141, 2147], [2181, 2186], [2236, 2242], [2265, 2270], [2376, 2381], [2460, 2465], [2525, 2530], [2540, 2546], [2585, 2591], [2743, 2749], [2793, 2797], [2972, 2980], [3259, 3267], [3612, 3620], [3810, 3814], [3948, 3954], [4051, 4059], [4247, 4257], [4262, 4273], [4352, 4363], [4463, 4468], [4476, 4486], [4488, 4493], [4543, 4557], [4674, 4682], [5788, 5799], [5985, 5993]], "wikipedia_ids": [134312, 25410, 2585670, 26149817, 9175519, 4504840, 21688353, 5819897, 9175519, 26149817, 9175519, 26149817, 9175519, 9175519, 9175519, 9175519, 26149817, 26149817, 26149817, 9175519, 2585670, 2585670, 2585670, 2585670, 5788249, 2585670, 116744, 63734, 35894697, 35894697, 125969, 6466, 14795432, 2585670, 17454, 3434750], "wikipedia_titles": ["Warwick, Rhode Island", "Rhode Island", "Lyne Bessette", "Jeremy Powers", "Todd Wells", "GT Bicycles", "Jamis Bicycles", "Tim Johnson (cyclist)", "Todd Wells", "Jeremy Powers", "Todd Wells", "Jeremy Powers", "Todd Wells", "Todd Wells", "Todd Wells", "Todd Wells", "Jeremy Powers", "Jeremy Powers", "Jeremy Powers", "Todd Wells", "Lyne Bessette", "Lyne Bessette", "Lyne Bessette", "Lyne Bessette", "Ridley Bikes", "Lyne Bessette", "Gloucester, Massachusetts", "Northampton", "Chris Jones (sprinter)", "Chris Jones (sprinter)", "Farmington, New Mexico", "Connecticut", "Mark McCormack (cyclist)", "Lyne Bessette", "Kansas City, Missouri", "United States"]}

Budding comic book artist Justin (Randy Harrison) finally left longtime lover Brian for a chance at ecstasy--and not a bit of agony   with a charming violin player. Emmett (Peter Paige) finally came face-to-face with his affection for friend Ted (Scott Lowell), only to have Ted's growing drug habit get in the way of their happiness. Lesbians Melanie (Michelle Clunie) and Lindsay (Thea Gill) decided to have another baby, whose father would be Michael (Hal Sparks), whose nesting with hunky Ben (Robert Gant) is rudely interrupted by runaway Hunter (Harris Allan). And as for Brian (Gale Harold), the man everybody wants but can't ever have? Just when it seems he's gone to work for the enemy--a homophobic mayoral candidate   it turns out he might be the savior the Pittsburgh gay community never knew it needed.\nSnaps to the makers of QAF for trying to bring their characters into the grown-up world    Michael, Emmett, and Ted started their own businesses; Justin finally cut loose from Brian   but too many melodramatic plot twists and turns impeded a lot of the character development this show worked hard at during its first two seasons. Still, most of the cast was topnotch, including Harrison, whose Justin finally came into his own, and the always dependable Harold, who made Brian a fascinating creature through all his steamy travails and over-the-top encounters. --Mark Englehart\nReader Reviews\nQUEER AS FOLK is still one of the most amazing TV Shows ever and is a landmark as the show for the new millennium. This New Queer As Folk Season 3 DVD Box Set has all 14 episodes of the third season of one of the most controversial and bravest series on television today. The BOX SET includes Bonus features such as: Behind-the-camera, Hot Summer Days, Wrap Party Reel, Enter Babylon LA, Meet the Folks, Animated Photo Gallery, Season Four Sneak Preview, Weblink, Music Videos, and a few other surprises. I have seen all 14 episodes of Season 3 and it is another great season with some major twists. I am a little upset that this season is very short when compared to season 1 and 2, which both had about 7 or 8 more episodes, but either way it is still a good season. I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Not every gay person lives a life like these guys, and I sure don't but thatis not what this show is about. Queer As Folk ia about the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something that we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think. Watch more than one episode before you judge this amazing series. I would just like to say Queer As Folk Season 1 and 2 are also great to own. I will be in line when they release Season 3 of Queer As Folk on DVD in February 2004.\nQueer as Folk - The Complete Third Season (Showtime) [VHS]\nAvailable from Amazon Price: $99.57 Updated on 2-28-2012.\nSPONSORED\u00a0LINKS\nDistinctVideo.com is offering Queer as Folk - The Complete Third Season (Showtime) VHS\n\n", "index": [[136, 144], [146, 149], [197, 205], [207, 210], [229, 242], [1016, 1029], [1059, 1069], [1212, 1226], [1350, 1361], [1424, 1436], [1530, 1545], [1560, 1569], [1632, 1642], [1675, 1686], [1721, 1727], [1729, 1741], [1762, 1773], [1945, 1955], [2583, 2596], [2859, 2866], [3038, 3045], [3617, 3627], [3797, 3804], [3839, 3847], [3915, 3928], [4261, 4264], [4574, 4587], [4591, 4594], [4819, 4827], [4829, 4832]], "wikipedia_ids": [77877, 52124, 77877, 52124, 289673, 289673, 25101, 970903, 1122009, 1766803, 23756068, 1122023, 642047, 1357712, 38791, 1243354, 10603995, 25101, 289673, 246038, 49547, 25101, 3434750, 77877, 289673, 11014498, 289673, 11014498, 77877, 52124], "wikipedia_titles": ["Showtime (TV network)", "VHS", "Showtime (TV network)", "VHS", "Queer as Folk (American TV series)", "Queer as Folk (American TV series)", "Pittsburgh", "Randy Harrison", "Peter Paige", "Scott Lowell", "Michelle Clunie", "Thea Gill", "Hal Sparks", "Robert Gant", "Hunting", "Harris Allan", "Gale Harold", "Pittsburgh", "Queer as Folk (American TV series)", "Box set", "Hyperlink", "Pittsburgh", "United States", "Showtime (TV network)", "Queer as Folk (American TV series)", "DVD", "Queer as Folk (American TV series)", "DVD", "Showtime (TV network)", "VHS"]}

My job was to review their progress in 2007 and give them ideas about how to grow their already profitable businesses in 2008.\nDuring that time, I taped an interview with J. Christoph Amberger for Today\u2019s Financial News, his multi-media e-letter. In the interview, Christoph and I discussed the coming economic recession, as well as the special opportunities a declining economy provides for entrepreneurs. I thought you\u2019d be interested in reading this rough transcript of our conversation\u2026\nJCA:\nThe American economy may or may not enter a recession in 2008. But even if the economy doesn\u2019t fulfill the technical criteria of a recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth), anyone doing business or working for a business these days is experiencing or expecting a severe downturn.\nMichael, we both have been through a couple of recessions and bear markets. What are the secrets to surviving a recession \u2013 and maybe even prospering in an adverse environment as an entrepreneur?\nMe:\nThat partly depends on the kind of recession. This one is different from recent downturns and stock market declines in three important ways.\nFirst, there is the fact of inflation. Oil has already hit record highs this year. Gold is on its way to $1,000 an ounce. And a gallon of gas is costing $4 in some states. Agricultural prices are going up too. One figure I saw had inflation pegged at 6.8 percent on an annual basis over the last three months. But it is actually worse than that. Because that figure was based on government-supplied data. Our government has made an art of obfuscation \u2013 of hiding certain economic realities. Inflation is already eating away at our buying power. It is bad and it is getting worse.\nNext, there is the falling dollar. The dollar is weaker now than it has ever been in history. That makes foreign goods more expensive. Which increases inflation. On the bright side, it makes US manufactured goods more attractive as exports. But in most areas, we still can\u2019t compete, price-wise, with China, India, and the Third World.\nThe third way this downturn is different is the level of debt. For the first time in modern history, American consumers owe more than they have. Credit card debt has skyrocketed. Mortgage debt, which increased enormously during the past 10 years as a result of irresponsible loans, is now at a crisis point because real estate values have fallen, making tens of thousands of loans untenable. It makes more sense to walk away from these loans than to renegotiate them. And behind all this is the federal debt \u2013 which has skyrocketed because of runaway spending by an earmark-addicted Congress and Bush\u2019s $3 trillion war.\nThese are our economic weaknesses \u2013 and they are big weaknesses. But there are strengths too. Unemployment numbers are relatively low. Earnings are relatively good. And new business start-ups \u2013 which to me is always the most important indicator \u2013 are still strong.\nUnemployment will certainly increase in some sectors. It is already a fact in the real estate market and will become a factor in banking and the financial industries that support real estate. But other sectors of the economy are okay for the moment. They may absorb some of these people. And new businesses will continue to create jobs, as they always have, because of the amazing growth of the Internet.\nWhat all that amounts to, in my book, is a period stagflation that may be followed by a recession but may simply continue to exist until our debts have been paid by the working man, as they always are.\nJCA:\nNot everyone is familiar with the term \"stagflation.\"\nMe:\n\"Stagflation\" was coined ages ago when I was still in college. It describes an economic period of both inflation and flat growth. The best description I\u2019ve heard was provided by Rich Karlgaard, publisher of Forbes. He said:\n\"Stagflation is present when gas and grocery prices are rising faster than your paycheck is \u2013 and in an economy that is strong enough to employ you but not strong enough that you feel emboldened to ask for a raise.\"\nThere are three ways to defeat stagflation: (1) Tighten the money supply. (2) Restrict credit. (3) Lower taxes.\nWhen too much money/too-easy credit is driving up prices \u2013 that\u2019s classic monetary inflation. This should tell the Fed to restrict the printing of money and tighten credit. But so far they\u2019ve been doing the opposite because they are afraid that if they tighten credit, the economy, which is already weak, will collapse.\nLowering taxes, particularly taxes on individual and corporate income, capital gains, and dividends would grow the economy by encouraging investment and stimulating production. This is classic supply-side economics. But it\u2019s very unpopular today. The common view is that tax cuts reduce the effectiveness of government and increase government debt. But the evidence contradicts this. Government receipts usually go up after tax cuts because the economy grows and there is more income and profits to tax. When you reduce the cost of doing something, you tend to get more of that thing. Reduce the tax costs of production in America and you will get more production. More production means more goods and services competing for your dollars. \"That\u2019s how prices go down, not up,\" says Rich Karlgaard.\nIt\u2019s simple. Supply and demand. If you want prices to go down, increase the supply. Incentivize the suppliers.\nBut that\u2019s probably not going to happen because it\u2019s not politically expedient for politicians to do it. Chances are our problems will be cured by a period of negative or flat growth along with inflation. This is the solution preferred by politicians because it is a way for average consumers to pay for government debt and bad loans without understanding they are paying for it. It\u2019s another form of taxation.\nAssuming we are entering a period of stagflation, certain investing principles apply:\nCash is king.\nBuy value.\nBuy into the recovery.\nInvest in what you know.\nLimit expenses.\nBe ready to seize opportunity when it arises. Because it will arise.\nJCA:\nUnemployment may kick-start some would-be entrepreneurs\u2019 plans to start their own businesses. Are there any particular sectors that you think will do well, especially for new businesses?\nMe:\nAs I said, I don\u2019t think unemployment is likely to be a huge problem \u2013 at least in the short run. But it will be a factor. More important will be the squeeze people will feel from stagflation. Prices are going up but not their salaries. This will trigger some start-ups. And there will also be lots of job displacements as some sectors of the economy \u2013 real estate-related \u2013 go down for a while and others \u2013 natural resources and even agriculture \u2013 go up. At some point in time \u2013 probably in the next year or two \u2013 real estate prices will bottom out. Then the vulture funds will come in and begin to buy up excess inventory. When that inventory is absorbed, the construction and building sectors will revive.\nIn the meantime, I favor:\nCertain investments \u2013 like gold, oil and gas, natural resources\nCertain services \u2013 such as for legal settlements, divorce settlements, business litigation settlements, home remodeling and repair\nInformation and advice on investing, retirement, estate planning, entrepreneurship, tax avoidance\nNatural supplements and pharmaceuticals\nRejuvenation products and services\nRetirement homes and other retirement businesses\nSoft exercises and sports \u2013 such as yoga, Pilates, tai chi\nSpiritual wealth information and products\nSelf-improvement information and products\nReal estate (longer term)\nJCA: Judging by the promises of our presidential candidates, US businesses will almost certainly be hit with higher taxes, compulsory health care contributions, higher labor costs. Is it still worthwhile setting up shop in America ? Or should entrepreneurs relocate to a more business-friendly climate\u2026 like Eastern Europe\u2026 or China\u2026 or the Caymans?\nMe:\nThere is a big misconception here. One I had until I began doing business overseas. Location of the business matters only in certain industries that depend on cheap, unskilled labor. If you are producing clothing or furniture, it makes sense to have a factory in the Third World. But if you are producing sophisticated products for which labor is a small part of the cost \u2013 or selling information or advice \u2013 you can do it from the U.S.\nInformation and advice is especially good because the brute labor cost is almost non-existent. Thanks to the Internet, the cost of storage and shipping is minimal, so you can easily produce your product here and sell it anywhere\u2026 anywhere in the world.\nIn the coming recession, I would want to be in a business that has the following characteristics: (1) positive cash flow, (2) no debt, (3) no accounts receivable, and (4) no merchandise to store. That amounts to a service business or information publishing. Of the two, information publishing is better. In fact, it is the best business to be in for the foreseeable future.\nThere are some advantages in setting up overseas, but there are also many disadvantages. I would not pick up shop and open up overseas unless I had a proven formula that was working in the U.S.\nJCA:\nThe title of your latest best-selling book is Ready, Fire, Aim.\nWhat do you think, Michael? Will the coming recession require entrepreneurs and business owners to aim BEFORE they fire?\nMe:\nEntrepreneurs must seize the day. You have to be READY to do that.\nWhen real estate prices bottom out, there will be a rush to buy from the vulture funds. Private investors must be ready with protocols, plans, and money.\nThe same holds true for any business you plan to launch. Don\u2019t waste valuable time and money trying to perfect it. Figure out a marketing proposition and test it as soon as you can. If it works, then refine it. If it doesn\u2019t work, move on to the next thing. Ready, Fire, Aim!\nJCA:\nWhat are the biggest mistakes an entrepreneur or business owner can make right now?\nMe:\nThere are three:\nStarting a new business without knowing anything about it. I call this the Principle of One Step Removed.\nWasting time and money on activities that are not directly related to sales.\nNot having a Disaster Recovery/Opportunity Plan.\nJCA:\nThat leads to my final question for you: Given today\u2019s economic climate, what does a new business have to have to give it the best chance of success?\nMe:\nIt\u2019s no different now than it\u2019s ever been.\nFirst is a management team with character, experience, and ingenuity.\nSecond is a plan that clearly identifies the way they will efficiently bring in customers from day one.\nThird is their use of resources. Will 80 percent of them be devoted to making a profitable sale?\nFourth is capital. Do they have enough of it?\nFifth is product. Does their lead product have a raison d\u2019etre in the marketplace?\nJCA:\nThanks for joining us today, Michael.\n[Ed.

Andrew Smith is a complete idiot!! Hey\nAndrew, if you have to put \"I have no evidence to prove this,\nbut it's true, and anyone who denies it is wrong.\" after everything\nyou say, then what your saying is most likely false or an opinion.\nKeep your god damned misinformation to your dumbfuck self!\nFor the record:\n1. I play violent computer\ngames, which I know for a _FACT_ have not made me violent.\n2. I watch violent films,\nwhich I know for a _FACT_ have not made me violent.\n3. I have access to information\nabout making bombs, which I know for a _FACT_ has not made me want\nto blow things up. I already wanted to blow things up before I had\naccess to that crap.\n4. I am in high school\nwhere I have not killed any of my classmates because I play violent\nvideo games and watch violent movies. (or for any other reason,\nfor that mater.)\nSome people may think\nthat these _FACTS_ make me biased. Perhaps I am, but that doesn't\nmake that Andrew Smith any smarter. People like him make me want\nto kill someone :-). But seriously, they drive me insane! Those\nirritating right-wing religious crackpots, moronic Republicans,\nand other idiots are always pushing shit like this at us. If you\nare a member of one of the aforementioned groups and you disagree\nwith me, suck my boomstick!!!!\nI'm sick and tired of\nflipping on the ol' boob toob and hearing video games, TV, and movies\ngetting blamed for things like the tradgedy in Littleton. Jesus Christ people!!! I know this has been said before, but it was an\nexcellent point: THE MEDIA IS NOT HERE TO BABYSIT THE YOUTH OF AMERICA!!!!!!!!!\nIf you look at all of these absolutely horrible tradgedies, you\nwill most likely see that the parents of killers either raised there\nkids in a terrible environment or they were hardly ever around.\nHow the hell does a kid make multiple bombs without his parents\nnoticing? His parents not paying any attention to anything he does,\nthat's how!!! Parents are here to police their kids before they\nare able to police themselves. They sure make sure that their son\nor daughter understands that violence hurts and that what happens\nin most movies and video games isn't real. More and more of these\ntragedies will occur until the parents of America start doing their\njob: to raise there children up sane and with a healthy sense of\nreality.

Especially, I have to say, older people (ie congressmen,\nreporters). So they think by not letting people under 18 buy games\nthey'll solve the worlds problems. But what about demos? What about\nthe ever-present warez copies? What about the store clerks that\ndon't give a damn? Is it going to be like buying cigarettes, or\nalcohol? If you under 26 you have to have an id, can't sell it within\n1000 yards of a school or church? If a parent buys it for thier\nkid...is that contributing to the delinquency of a minor?\nMaybe a better idea would be to not let anyone under 18 watch the\nnews!

And that B.S. about them losing\ntouch with reality.....didn't know they weren't playing a game.\nEvery game out there has a teamplay mode where you aren't supposed\nto kill teammates... aren't all humans essentially teammates at\nthe very least.\nWell, that's enough of\nmy late night ranting....if it sounds weird that's cuz it's 5 in\nthe morning....But I'm sick and tired of people blaming everyone\nelse for everything they do wrong.\nNo one will accept the\nblame anymore. If they really have to blame someone else for what\nkids are doing wrong then blame the parents, blame the education\nsystem, blame the pressures of society....just leave us gamers to\nour vegetating.\nJason \"FoOeY\" Rushton\nYou make a good point...most\nhard-core gamers are serious agoraphobiacs. The concept of sunlight\nscares them more than anything. :)\nStill\nmore on the Colorado incident...\nFrom:\nJames Hendrick\nSubject: The Doomworld editorial\nDear Mailbag,\nI'm not going to spend much in time or length at this, because nobody\never reads the long letters, and besides Frasier comes on in twenty\nminutes. But I've got to say something, to make some opposition,\nbecause the integrity of the gaming community is being defended\nby a prominent editorial that would better have served us had it\nnever been written at all.\nThe editorial, by Dukrous\nof Doomworld.com, was made reference to by an article on CNN, as\nreported on Blue's today (the 28th). Suffice it to say that this\neditorial has not gone unnoticed. I was personally very curious\nto see what Doomworld had to say about the Columbine shootings,\nsince the Doom community is under very close scrutiny right now\nfor reasons that don't need to be reviewed. So I read this editorial\nand was severely disappointed.\nInstead of an intelligent,\nmature, receptive response, the author has published a quasi-intellectual\ntreatise that attempts to guild youthful conviction and self-importance\nin what was probably intended to be an impressive display of philosophical\nrigor and noble uprightness. It fails. Debunking his reasoning is\nbusy work, labor not worth its me. What disappoints me so greatly\nin this editorial are not its oversights, gross generalizations,\nleaps of logic, and innumerable contradictions, but its outright\nignorance: the absence of consideration in the author's commanding\ntone, the sense of smug triumph that he conveys with every ludicrous\nconclusion. He would be at fault for this regardless of the merit\nof his ideas. And he is definitely to be faulted for making the\nhorror at Columbine into a platform on which to parade his intellect\nand character.\n\"Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by\nunderstanding.\" What is needed is not increased regulation,\nvigilance, and inquisition. These are short-sighted answers. What\nwe are lacking is understanding.\nSincerely,\nJames Hendrick\nalso an avid gamer, aka Mr. White and Mr. Wizard\nFrom:\nRobert J. Denchy\nSubject: Shootings and \"experts\" with no clue\nBlue / Loonyboi,\nI happened to turn on the TV last night and catch a part of an interview\nlast night. I think it was on 20/20. I only watched about two minutes\nof it before I turned off the TV.\nThey had some military \"expert\" talking about the shooting\nof the kids as they were coming out of a bible study. (Not the most\nrecent shooting.) He was explaining how it was obvious that the\ngames the kid played gave him the skills to kill his classmates.\nThis expert obviously looked for ways to prove his points rather\nthan looking at the situation objectively. Otherwise, he would have\nseen that his points actually prove the game did NOT provide the\n\"skills\" used.\nHis Point: It was amazing that the kid scored 5 out of 8 shots.\nThis shows an incredible aptitude above that of experts that are\ntrained to shoot. For example, in a recent shooting, four trained\npolicemen were in a shoot-out and only 19 of 43 shots were good.\nAlthough there were multiple people in the classroom it was a large\nroom.\nMy Point: Apples and Oranges. It's too bad that most people will\ntake this at face value. Shooting at unarmed people that are not\nhiding under behind cover is a completely different situation than\nwhen someone is shooting back at you. Shooting at one or two people\nis not the same as shooting at 40 people. I don't care how big the\nroom was, the kids were grouped together in a contained area. And\nshooting at one person still meant that others were likely to be\nhit if the shot missed the intended target. The expert may argue\nthis but then he is probably the type of fool that would try to\ntake out an armed terrorist surrounded by 30 hostages. In the real\nworld the good guys won't shoot because the chance of hitting someone\nother than the person they are aiming at is too high.\nHis Point: He shot once at each target which is the way the games\nteach people to shoot. Shoot one target and quickly move on to the\nnext. This goes against what a trained person would do; trained\npeople shoot until the target goes down.\nMy Point: The kid was not trained! He did exactly what makes sense\nfor someone attempting to create as much damage to as many people\nas possible. He didn't care if he killed his target or not. People\nthat are trained are trained to take out their target who is a danger\nto them. These \"targets\" were NOT a threat. Finally, one\nof the most common death match rules is to STAY ON TARGET. Why?\nBecause, your targets are threats to you. If you divide your fire\nbetween multiple targets you are likely to kill none of them. This\nin turn means there is more fire being directed at you. Further\nmore, for all we know, he WAS shooting at the same target. He could\nhave missed with ever shot and only managed to hit the people around\nhis intended target(s).\nHis Point: He shot at the head because the games award head shots.\nMy Point: Gee, which game is that? Some games award more points\nor more damage for head shots but not games like Doom, Quake, Quake II, etc. In fact, it is only the most recent crop of games that\naward points for head shots. In general, the games actually teach\nthe same thing that a defense course would teach, shoot at the point\nwhere you are most likely to hit...center of mass.\nAnyway, the point is that this \"expert\" is nothing of\nthe sort. He has made poor arguments that, when looked at logically,\nactually prove that the games did not train this kid... He has made\nassumption and taken them as facts and then tried to make the circumstances\nmatch those \"facts\".\nThis kid acted contrary to the best tactics for FPS games. This\nkid did what makes sense for someone who is looking to harm as many\npeople as possible.\nAs a side note, the government and people with no clue are once\nagain trying to use these shootings as a way to increase gun control.\nWhy do we need more gun control when the current laws are not being\nenforced. After all, it is illegal for a minor (under 18) to purchase\na weapon. It is illegal for anyone under 21 to purchase a handgun.\nIt is illegal to have guns on school property (Believe the law states\nsomething like guns are not allowed within 500 yards of a school).\n-Palandar.\nrjdenchy@flash.net\nFrom:\nAlex Brown\nSubject: Jocks vs Geeks?\nDear Blue's News,\nI know that a lot of folks\nwho write in to you are termed \"geeks\" and they all seem\nto express a deep resentment of their more \"popular\" peers.\nI want to let everyone know that there are other shades of grey.\nIn high school I was a Jock. However I wasnt the greatest one in\nthe world. Guess what else I did? Surf the Internet, play games\nlike Doom, and yes, I did well in school. So what we have here is\nsomeone - mainly myself, who was a geek and a jock hybrid. I was\nmore popular than people who were just normal kids who didnt belong\nto clubs, yet I was not as popular as some of the more exceptional\nathletes and their click. I am aghast to see that there are so many\npeople who are on the far ends of the spectrum.\nIs that the reality?\nOr is that the only group who is being allowed to have their voices\nheard because of the resentment of the \"popular\" in the\ncomputer community? Is there no middle ground? Are any of these\nopposing sides taking steps to understand each other? I believe\nthat there needs to be more effort between people to understand\neach other. It seems like we have a social \"race war\"\ngoing on, and just like society needed/needs to come to terms with\nethnic and race differences, we need to come to terms with social\nones.\nI agree completely\nwith you, but there's a problem here...you and I are both out of\nhigh school. When I was in high school (shudder) I thought of things\nin those same strange terms...there were \"jocks\" and \"geeks\"\nand well, then there was me. :)\nMy point is this:\nwe can talk rationally about this now because it's behind us. But\nfor kids who are still in high school, it's a different story entirely.\nAnd it's not something easily solved, either.\nNow\nhere's some logic I agree with...\nFrom:\nJim Beasley\nSubject: Whats really behind the Littleton Tragedy...\nI'm sick of hearing that\ncomputer games were somehow responsible for the terrible tragedy\nin Littleton\n", "index": [[264, 270], [584, 586], [733, 736], [903, 906], [917, 925], [1205, 1213], [1303, 1313], [1391, 1394], [1491, 1494], [1836, 1839], [2749, 2756], [2790, 2797], [4117, 4128], [4431, 4440], [4442, 4454], [5226, 5233], [5405, 5407], [5806, 5812], [6270, 6277], [6310, 6319], [6327, 6332], [6337, 6344], [6452, 6460], [6488, 6491], [6708, 6715], [6800, 6810], [6834, 6836], [6945, 6957], [7068, 7073], [7181, 7183], [7215, 7219], [8285, 8289], [8475, 8480], [9650, 9657], [9981, 9984], [10130, 10139], [10192, 10196], [11132, 11141], [13964, 13970], [14515, 14519], [14521, 14526], [14528, 14536], [15120, 15123], [16022, 16026], [16133, 16137], [17691, 17700]], "wikipedia_ids": [5396418, 25215, 19006979, 19006979, 49132, 49132, 3747, 19006979, 19006979, 19006979, 38368, 38368, 32070, 6520746, 1095706, 3434750, 39565408, 33430, 25215, 19006979, 6097297, 18890, 603624, 19006979, 38368, 3747, 22194, 38368, 21347643, 39565408, 12821, 22364401, 18377, 11685, 62028, 57838943, 22364401, 59627, 18581242, 22364401, 7900613, 25216, 25395149, 2734619, 22364401, 6520746], "wikipedia_titles": ["Unreal", "Quake III Arena", "Mac (computer)", "Mac (computer)", "Marathon", "Marathon", "Bill Gates", "Mac (computer)", "Mac (computer)", "Mac (computer)", "John Carmack", "John Carmack", "Republican Party (United States)", "Littleton, Colorado", "Jesus", "United States", "Socialist Party (France)", "Wolfenstein 3D", "Quake III Arena", "Mac (computer)", "Linux", "Microsoft Windows", "Executor", "Mac (computer)", "John Carmack", "Bill Gates", "Operating system", "John Carmack", "Mac operating systems", "Socialist Party (France)", "Gate", "Doom (franchise)", "Lunatic", "Frasier", "CNN", "Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)", "Doom (franchise)", "Columbine High School massacre", "Target Corporation", "Doom (franchise)", "Quake (natural phenomenon)", "Quake II", "First-person shooter", "Jock (stereotype)", "Doom (franchise)", "Littleton, Colorado"]}

This includes both the purely imaginative (probably won't\nhappen) and the speculative (might happen). Fantasy in this sense is not on\na continuum against science fiction, it is on a continuum against realism.\n(Although \"continuum\" implies that it's something resembling a straight line, which I would not be willing to defend.)\nOne possible rule of thumb: it is a fantasy if filming it would require obvious special effects.\nThere is a smaller definition of fantasy, call it fantasy definition 2, which basically means \"vaguely resembling Tolkien.\" I believe this is a marketing distinction rather than a literary one, since it doesn't even include most fantasy. It does have a vigorous fan base, however. That fact leads the term \"fantasy\" to be used as shorthand for \"this particular type of fantasy involving elves and dragons and such.\" So -- those types of stories clearly are fantasy, but they are not the definition of fantasy. They are not the container, they are one of the things contained.\nMost of what we think of as \"genre\" is really just marketing. They put the books in whatever section they expect people to look for them in. So, The Handmaid's Tale is in unclassified \"literature\" because Margaret Atwood isn't marketed as a science fiction writer. It doesn't have any bearing on whether the book is science fiction. And it's not supposed to. It's supposed to help Atwood fans find her stuff.\nSufficiently popular fantastic writers will often get moved to the \"literature\" section -- it doesn't make any difference to the content of the books.\nOne common way people attempt to distinguish science fiction from (other) fantasy is to claim that science fiction is about what is \"possible.\" This definition is problematic because \"possible\" is not intrinsic to the work. Real world possibilities are always shifting -- some things that seemed impossible once are now possible, other things which once seemed possible are now thought to be impossible. Re: any 50s science fiction about faster than light travel, or life on the Moon or Mars.\nThis definition would lead us to the fairly awkward position of deciding that most \"golden age\" SF is no longer science fiction, because it is now known to be fantasy.\nBut, people don't tend to do that -- we still see Podkayne of Mars\nas science fiction. So obviously, we're using a qualifier other than \"what\nis now possible.\"\nYou might at this point be tempted to use \"what the author thought was possible at the time it was written\" as a qualifier, but this is still problematic, because the author's personal beliefs are also not intrinsic to the work. We can't conclude that every SF writer who deals in time travel to the past actually believes such a thing is possible.\nSo, what makes something science fiction, if it isn't the fact that its scientific premise is possible, or that the author believed it was possible when the story was written?\nWell, let's look at Frankenstein, held by many to be the first science\nfiction novel. Mary Shelley writes of a man assembling a new man out of parts\nof dead men, then bringing him to life through unspecified scientific means.\n(Note: movies have implied that this means was electricity. The novel doesn't say, ostensibly because Dr. Frankenstein doesn't want anyone to replicate his methods. But other writings by Mary Shelley at the time show that she was familiar with experiments in galvanism and that her knowledge that a frog's limb could be brought to \"life\" with electricity probably did influence her thinking when writing the novel.)\nThere was no concept of scientifiction (early name for SF) in her day, so in\nher mind she was writing a horrific fantasy, and her twist on it was to involve\nmodern science. Also, we now know that what she describes in Frankenstein\nis impossible -- an intact and very recently deceased body might be brought\nback to life through electricity, but a sewn-together collection of corpses\nnever could.\nAnd yet, the book is retroactively classified as science fiction, and nobody seriously objects. Why is that?\nWell, its premise is scientific -- it can be expressed as \"suppose, using science, we could do X.\" Also, it is concerned with the effect of technology and scientific discoveries on the human psyche and human society, addressing concepts such as unintended consequences and creator responsibility.\nSo, it is science fiction because it wrestles with scientific issues and concepts. \"Being science fiction\" is essentially an attribute of what is otherwise a fantasy novel.\nBut, if you still think SF and fantasy are two distinct and separate genres,\nconsider: Is alternate history science fiction, because it is generally published\nas science fiction? Or is it only science fiction if it involves quantum multiple\nuniverses theory, or if the change catalyst is something specifically scientific?\n(I mean, The Difference Engine, which is alternate history specifically\nbased on technology, as opposed to The Man in the High Castle which\nis alternate history based on a different military outcome to World War II.)\nOr is all alternate history science fiction because Philip K. Dick, an SF writer,\nwrote the first one? Is Zelazny's Amber series SF with fantasy trappings, or\nfantasy with vague pretensions of being science fiction? Is Edgar Rice Burrough's\nMars series science fiction, even though it has no scientific elements other\nthan being set on Mars? How about the works of China Mieville, who writes extremely\nstrange industrial alternate world fantasy which is also science fiction and\nhorror? Or about Lovecraft -- his Dreamlands series is pure fantasy, but most\nof his Cthulhu Mythos stories are more or less science fiction. And what would\nyou make of Terry Pratchett's novel Strata -- SF in which space explorers\nland on a disc-shaped planet and discover an absurd world built by beings so\nadvanced that the result is indistinguishable from magic?\n(He wrote it in 1981, so it predates any of the Discworld books -- however, the flat world is clearly a Discworld prototype.)\nWhile there are certainly loose and generalized distinctions between most SF\n", "index": [[1148, 1155], [1755, 1774], [1815, 1830], [1991, 1997], [2649, 2653], [2657, 2661], [2759, 2761], [2881, 2889], [2893, 2897], [3249, 3251], [3536, 3548], [3602, 3614], [3848, 3860], [3929, 3941], [4182, 4196], [4213, 4215], [4376, 4388], [5157, 5159], [5465, 5486], [5563, 5589], [5658, 5670], [5725, 5739], [5744, 5746], [5779, 5786], [5802, 5804], [5892, 5911], [6009, 6013], [6169, 6178], [6186, 6196], [6237, 6251], [6321, 6336], [6345, 6351], [6355, 6357], [6566, 6575], [6622, 6631], [6718, 6720]], "wikipedia_ids": [15872, 4265319, 60280, 60280, 19331, 14640471, 26787, 45927, 14640471, 26787, 18580673, 27885687, 18580673, 27885687, 26787, 26787, 18580673, 26787, 245885, 45903, 32927, 23005, 26787, 37736, 26787, 9657, 14640471, 13509, 592879, 5725, 30029, 275376, 26787, 25560410, 25560410, 26787], "wikipedia_titles": ["J.

Posted November 15, 2011.\n\u201cAnd have nothing to do with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather expose them\u201d (Ephesians 5:11).\nTAMPA, FL (FR) \u2013 Abortionist Jos\u00e9 Raul Quintana works for\nGary Dresden\u2019s\nAll Women\u2019s\nHealth Center abortion chain. On November 12, 2011 a dozen sidewalk evangelists conducted a neighborhood awareness campaign at Quintana\u2019s residence.\nThe campaign began in the parking lot of St Paul\u2019s Catholic Church at 2 pm and lasted until 4. About 12 street evangelists from Orlando, Riverview, New Port Richey, Cleawarer and Tampa first marched through the Quintana neighborhood and then stood at the intersection of the street as hundreds of people drove by to attend a wedding mass across the street. One awareness campaign participant passed out flyers to passers-by.\nAt about 2:30 pm, the neighbors across the street returned to their home and began to confront the street evangelists claiming that the signs depicting graphic representations of aborted children were offensive. Jos\u00e9 Quintana was not present during the campaign. At several points, the Quintana family and some teenage boys who are friends of the Quintanas began to angrily confront the street evangelists saying that the demonstrators had no right to be in a \u201crestricted neighborhood.\u201d\nThe police were called and immediately explained that they were acting as peace officers and not taking sides. They also explained to all involved that it is the right of Americans to assemble and speak in a public right of way.\nAs Deanna Waller messaged from the event, \u201cToday we were spit at, cursed at, kicked at, called names, had mulch thrown on us and sprinklers turned on us for Jesus \u2026 All in a day\u2019s work!

He case was used to challenge the Texas abortion law and she eventually became the Jane Roe of the 1973 US Supreme Court decision, Roe v Wade. She never had an abortion, but instead became an icon in the national abortion debate. For 22 years, Norma McCorvey\u2019s life was a battlefield. She worked inside abortion clinics. She promoted legalized abortion. But she was tormented by what she saw and felt. In the summer of 1995, her life changed forever.\nThrough the friendship of a pro-life leader and a special invitation from a 7-year old child, Jane Roe finally died so Norma Leah McCorvey could live.

Regrettably, these discoveries have often been ignored by the skeptics as well as by the popular media. As a result, the liberal view still holds sway in universities and impacts the culture and even much of the church.\nThe Real Jesus explodes the myths of these critics and the movies, books and television programs that have popularized their views. Presented in ten parts \u2014 perfect for individual, family and classroom study \u2014 viewers will be challenged to go deeper in their knowledge of Christ in order to be able to defend their faith and present the truth to a skeptical modern world \u2013 that the Jesus of the Gospels is the Jesus of history \u2014 \u201cthe same yesterday, today and forever\u201d (Hebrews 13:8).\nHe is the real Jesus.\nSpeakers include: George Grant, Ted Baehr, Stephen Mansfield, Raymond Ortlund, Phil Kayser, David Lutzweiler, Jay Grimstead, J.P.

It not only references abortion\u2019s specific target \u2013 the sacred matrix where human beings are formed in the womb in the very image of God, but it also implies the existence of a conspiracy, a matrix of seemingly disparate forces that are driving this holocaust.\nThe occult activity surrounding the abortion industry is exposed with numerous examples. But are these just aberrations, bizarre yet anomalous examples of abortionists who just happen to have ties to\nmodern day witchcraft? Or is this representative of something deeper, more sinister and even endemic to the entire abortion movement?\nAs the allusion to the film of over a decade ago suggests, the viewer may learn that things are not always as they appear to be. The Abortion Matrix reveals the reality of child-killing and strikes the proper moral chord to move hearts to fulfill the biblical responsibility to rescue those unjustly sentenced to death and to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves (Proverbs 24:11,12; 31:8,9).\nSpeakers include: George Grant, Peter Hammond, RC Sproul Jr., Paul Jehle, Lou Engle, Rusty Thomas, Flip Benham, Janet Porter and many more.\nTen parts, over three hours of instruction!\nRunning Time: 195 minutes\n$19.95 \u2014 ORDER NOW!\n(We accept all major credit cards and PayPal.)\nClick here for more information\nGo Stand Speak\u00a0(DVD)\nWith \u201cpreaching to the lost\u201d being such a basic foundation of Christianity, why do many in the church seem to be apathetic on this issue of preaching in highways and byways of towns and cities?\nIs it biblical to stand in the public places of the world and proclaim the gospel, regardless if people want to hear it or not?\nDoes the Bible really call church pastors, leaders and evangelists to proclaim the gospel in the public square as part of obedience to the Great Commission, or is public preaching something that is outdated and not applicable for our day and age?\nThese any many other questions are answered in this documentary.\n$19.95 \u2014 ORDER NOW!\n(We accept all major credit cards and PayPal.)\nClick here for more information\nShare\n|\nView CCNow Cart/Checkout\nUse an RSS Feed Reader?\nSubscribe to\nThe Forerunner\nHave The Forerunner Weblog sent straight to your inbox!\nEnter your email address:\nThe Forerunner\nChannel on YouTube\nFeatured Product\nIf you like the articles on this website, you may also be interested in:\nFeatured Articles\nThe Abortion Matrix DVD: Update\nThe Abortion Matrix:\nDefeating Child Sacrifice and the Culture of Death is a 195-minute presentation that traces the biblical roots of child sacrifice and then delves into the social, political and cultural fall-out that this sin against God has produced.

It was from a production assistant at Allure Magazine, asking how they could get in touch with two of my team riders, the beautiful and talented twins Sierra and Hailey Partridge.\nOne thing led to another and within a few weeks the girls were flown down to a shoot on the beach in Southern California to do a piece on Surfing Beauties.\nThe twins on the Allure Surfing Beauties set with Roxy pro surfer Kassia Meador and the other models.\nIt was not their first time modeling, they\u2019ve been modeling for Betty Belts, Hobie and O'Neill in exotic places like Maui and The Big Island as well as in their beautiful home in Santa Cruz. But my little company, Betty Belts, was the first sponsor to bring them into the public eye and really help get their careers taking off. The contribution of my absurdly talented husband-to-be, photographer David Pu\u2019u is a key factor. A former pro surfer himself, he has been very supportive of my team riders and women\u2019s surfing. See David\u2019s work and more of the girls on my website www.bettybelts.com.\nHailey Partridge, a surfing beauty ready for a camera.\nI asked Sierra and Hailey about their Allure experience and here\u2019s what they had to say along with some snapshots they took from the day.\nWhat you enjoyed most?\nHailey: The shoot with Allure was an amazing experience that I was very fortunate to have experienced. What I enjoyed most about the shoot was what Sierra and I called \u201cthe star treatment\u201d. We were picked up from the airport in an Escalade, we stayed at the Ritz Carlton (and got to order lots of room service!), we got manicures and pedicures from a professional manicurist who does Hollywood stars\u2019 nails and our hair styled by a hair stylist flown all the way from London. They had two huge trailers for us to relax in and they delivered us catered breakfast and lunch. Overall, it was an amazing experience, everything they did for us and the other models was a little extravagant but I wasn\u2019t complaining! I also really enjoyed getting to meet Kassia Meador (Roxy surfer) as well as the other two models, Katarina Lyerly and Megan Abrigo, they were all so friendly and were very genuine and down-to-earth girls.\nHailey Partridge getting the \u201cstar treatment\u201d in the hair and makeup trailer: a rubdown with body oil.\nWhat you learned?\nSierra: I learned that there is so much work that goes into a magazine. This was just one article and it took a month to plan and about 30 people behind the scenes to bring it all together.\nYour favorite shoot so far?\nHailey: My favorite shoot was the 2007 Hobie swimwear shoot in Kona last November with David Pu\u2019u.

{"id": "clueweb12-0503wb-96-11521", "bracket": "0.5-0.6", "text": "History of Northfield Vermont\nNorthfield History\nby Julia McIntire\nIn 1790, when the United States government established its first census, it recorded forty-four persons (fifteen adults and twenty-nine children) living in the tiny and isolated Town of Northfield. Amos Robinson, the first to arrive, was a proprietor of the town chartered in 1781, and was actually the only original proprietor to make his home here.\nElijah Paine, son of an influential family, Harvard graduate, Revolutionary soldier, lawyer, friend of George Washington and a proprietor of Northfield and nearby Williamstown, had cleared land on Northfield's Mill Hill. He built a grist and saw mill which soon became the center of business and social activity for the settlement.\nOn March 12, 1794, the first town meeting was held at Dr. Nathaniel Robinson's home on East Hill. As more settlers came to town, they abandoned the hilltops and built their homes westward down Mill Hill, until by the early 19th century, a small hamlet (today's South Village) had grown up along Sunny Brook and the Dog River. The village, known as Slab City because of the saw mills established there, also contained potash and grist mills.\nIn 1799 Elijah Paine built the famous Paine Turnpike which ran from Brookfield, through northern Northfield, to Montpelier, opening up trade and travel on this Boston-Montreal route.\nBy the 1840s the settlement had crept northward from South Village to land along the Dog River, known then and now as the Center. What is today's \"downtown\" was originally a heavily forested swampy area. In the early 1800s Elijah Paine acquired this land, cleared it, built a dam on the Dog River and erected a woolen mill. The last to be settled was the \"Falls,\" north of Factory Village, which was, and still is, a small closely knit settlement.\nIn 1848 these four small villages began to flourish, thanks to their leading citizen, Charles Paine. Like his father Elijah, Charles was well educated, shrewd and personable. He was governor of Vermont from 1841 to 1843, and in 1845 became president of the newly chartered Vermont Central Railroad. He built the headquarters in Northfield, much to the disappointment of Barre and Montpelier. In its extensive yard, the railroad built and repaired engines and cars. The many Irish who poured into town to work on the railroad became permanent residents.\nIn 1853 the Vermont Central Railroad went into bankruptcy due to over expansion and, in some cases, mismanagement, and bit by bit hard times came to Northfield. The railroad, placed under receivership and renamed the Central Vermont Railroad, had its headquarters moved to St. Albans.\nIn the 1870s, the slate industry, although short-lived, eased Northfield's economic depression. Welsh workmen, skilled in cutting and splitting slate, arrived in town and contributed to its development.\nThe granite industry, particularly under the business acumen of five Cross brothers, brought new life to the town in the 1890s and early 1900s. Their stone sheds, plus those of the Ellis Company, the Pelaggi Company, Phillips & Slack Inc., and others, employed hundreds of workers, many of them newly arrived Italians, Spaniards and Scots. Gradually the Northfield granite industry drifted to the great granite center in nearby Barre.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, other industry rejuvenated Northfield. The old Nantanna Mill under Bernard Goldfine's ownership produced fine woolen goods. The Rabbit hollow Knitting Mill; the Wood Products Co.; the Northfield Telephone Co. and its later outgrowth, Trans-Video Cable Television; Cetrangolo's granite finishing works; and a new shopping center brought much-needed employment.\nThe largest industry in town is unquestionably Norwich University which was started in 1869 and remained a small college for several decades. This venerable military university employs hundreds of people, adds property support to the town, and spends millions of dollars each year in supplies and services in Central Vermont. In 1950, Major General Ernest Harmon became President of Norwich where he spent fifteen years and brought enrollment from 300 cadets to well over 1,300.\nIn spite of many changes, Northfield still retains many characteristics of its old-time four villages - the South Village with its Red Mill; the Center, home of Norwich University\n", "index": [[30, 40], [85, 98], [245, 249], [253, 263], [418, 430], [462, 469], [480, 493], [521, 538], [559, 569], [581, 593], [615, 625], [1098, 1107], [1199, 1211], [1259, 1269], [1288, 1298], [1303, 1313], [1351, 1357], [1358, 1366], [1597, 1609], [1747, 1762], [1908, 1921], [1939, 1945], [1947, 1954], [2016, 2023], [2095, 2119], [2150, 2160], [2192, 2197], [2202, 2212], [2296, 2301], [2387, 2411], [2524, 2534], [2592, 2616], [2648, 2658], [2722, 2732], [2756, 2761], [2932, 2937], [3172, 3180], [3182, 3191], [3196, 3201], [3217, 3227], [3291, 3296], [3349, 3359], [3729, 3747], [3991, 4006], [4031, 4044], [4065, 4072], [4187, 4197], [4322, 4340]], "wikipedia_ids": [260264, 3434750, 52911, 260264, 21828627, 18426501, 38584728, 11968, 260264, 137365, 260264, 137356, 21828627, 84080, 260264, 41992, 24437894, 7954681, 21828627, 635166, 5940936, 21828627, 5940936, 1184973, 1184973, 260264, 260257, 41992, 14560, 1184973, 260264, 1184973, 8797673, 260264, 69894, 30871900, 14532, 26667, 26994, 260264, 260257, 260264, 2063664, 1184973, 17225667, 2063664, 260264, 2063664], "wikipedia_titles": ["Northfield, Vermont", "United States", "Town", "Northfield, Vermont", "Elijah Paine", "Harvard University", "Revolutionary", "George Washington", "Northfield, Vermont", "Williamstown, Vermont", "Northfield, Vermont", "Randolph, Vermont", "Elijah Paine", "Brookfield, Connecticut", "Northfield, Vermont", "Montpelier, Vermont", "Boston", "Montreal", "Elijah Paine", "Mill town", "Charles Paine", "Elijah Paine", "Charles Paine", "Central Vermont Railway", "Central Vermont Railway", "Northfield, Vermont", "Barre, Vermont (town)", "Montpelier, Vermont", "Republic of Ireland", "Central Vermont Railway", "Northfield, Vermont", "Central Vermont Railway", "St. Albans station (LIRR)", "Northfield, Vermont", "Wales", "Cross (association football)", "Italy", "Spain", "Scotland", "Northfield, Vermont", "Barre, Vermont (town)", "Northfield, Vermont", "Norwich University", "Central Vermont Railway", "Ernest N.

A little while ago I was approached by the very lovely Susie James and her team from Funny Farm Fitness in WA to run a two-day (live-in) RYL Program for her and her clients from July 31 \u2013 August 2. Susie has kindly agreed to open the program up to anyone from the West (or East for that matter) who might like to come along for two days of life-changing motivation, inspiration and education. The program will be identical to the one we\u2019re running here in Victoria next month. Although I will be two months older. And wiser.\nOkay, older.\nIf you would like to book a place or talk to Susie, she can be contacted during business hours on 0438 910 664 or you can email her at funnyfarmfitness@bigpond.com. The venue for the program is Club Capricorn, Two Rocks Road, Yanchep. I hope to see some of you there.\nVertically Challenged\nMost of my long-time readers will know that as a teenager I was a somewhat\u2026 er.. voluptuous. Full-figured. Thick-set. Stocky. Big-boned. Solid. Sure the experts might have classified me as obese, but I preferred to see myself as\u2026 short for my weight. Vertically challenged for my mass. It was totally about my height and not my weight.\nSee, it\u2019s a perspective thing.\nOr a denial thing.\nOkay, I was a whopper.\nButtons Being Pushed\nAnyway, a few of the ex-fat kid\u2019s buttons have been pushed lately because there has been talk here in the Land Down Under about weighing kids at school in a kind of annual physiological assessment; essentially a height measurement, some weighing and a BMI calculation. I can hear the screams of protest starting before I even finish this sentence. But what if it\u2019s done in a completely clinical manner and only the parent, the clinician and the child know the outcome of the test? Does the idea still suck then? Does the idea suck at all? Maybe you like it? Perhaps the only way to address childhood obesity is in a practical manner such as this? After all, it gives us a measurable, objective and scientific assessment of where the child is at and how they are tracking over time.\nMore Education?\nSurely, if the answer to the obesity problem was to pump the kids and parents full of more information, then our kids would be shrinking by the day because we\u2019ve got obesity-related information and education coming out of our ears\u2026 yet they ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 no smaller. Er, any smaller.\nWhat do You Think?\nToday\u2019s instalment is more of a discussion than it is a lesson, so I look forward to seeing what the group consensus will be on this topic. I think the idea has some merit but I\u2019m not totally sold. I would need to know a little more about how the overall concept would be implemented and developed over the long term before I could give it my tick of approval. And we all know how much the government values my opinion. As an ex-fatty, I think I would have appreciated a little short-term pain for some long-term gain. But then again, maybe the chocolate cake-eating, fat fourteen year-old \u2018me\u2019 would think that his older counterpart is a big tool.\nYour thoughts?\nAbout the weighing that is. Not whether or not I\u2019m a tool.\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to leave a comment, click here. Yep, even you chronic Lurkers.

Children compare results all the time, they care very little between their hearing and sight tests compared to how much they would about weight. Please remember how competetive children are and how cruel they can be in their comparisons that would inevitably result from these weigh-ins.\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 15, 2009 at 7:46 pm\nIf parents limited the time their child spends on low-activity such as television watching, DVDs, computer and other electronic games we wouldn\u2019t need to weigh kids in school.Ally\nReply\nJules\nApril 15, 2009 at 7:48 pm\nI remember two days in particular from my school days (err years \u2013 all 13 of them). The first was in Grade 5 or 6. We all got weighed and it was writen on a chart. For all to see. What purpose does that serve? I hated it. The second day was in Yr 7. First class of physical education for the year we were all lined up and got weighed by teacher. Kids all share their weight. Just like saying \u2018what did you get [in the maths test].\u2019 Then we did the dreaded \u2018beep test\u2019 (shuttle run it\u2019s also called). I loved that as much as you loved Swimming Carnival day.\nI\u2019d maybe give it the heads up if I knew more about the process and what they would do, as a school to help improve it. Maybe Mr Rudd (Australian prime minister) could fund daily small group fitness sessions at your kids gym all year round? Open up Gecko centres around Australia. Then go global. AND, instead of having the parentals dropping kid off and returning an hour later, get them involved in the fitness class. Problems of childhood and adult obesity solved and kid and parent(s) all live to 130yo.\n[My head too busy to argue with self and others. I'm prioritising sleep over fitness for next couple of days. I'm okay with that. Mostly.]\nJules(Bayside Melbourne)\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 15, 2009 at 8:36 pm\nGood point GJ\u2026\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 15, 2009 at 8:37 pm\nIf only they would Ally..\nReply\ncarolp\nApril 15, 2009 at 8:54 pm\nWell it may surprise you but this already happens in many secondary schools in Victoria as part of a physical education class\u2026..BMIs are worked out and then fitness tests are completed.\nSupposedly all in private and very sensitively done\u2026.BUT in my experience as a secondary teacher (no not phys ed)the teachers conducting these tests are already the fit and sporty ones\u2026and hence have little concept of the pain caused to those who are not so fit or sporty\u2026although it is private everyone knows who is fit/overweight etc and it does nothing except cause the unfit ones to manufacture excuses\u2026forge notes or wag school to avoid these dreaded weighings\u2026.i \u2018get\u2019 that in theory it seems a good idea but in practise (to me) it only seems to cement the negative body image which these kids already have\u2026.it my mind we should do more to encourage even the \u2018non sporty\u2019 ones to enjoy sport rather than constantly rewarding those who are \u2018good\u2019 until the others give up\u2026\u2026..very very few girls continue with sport after year 10\u2026.and no one makes a move to reverse this trend\u2026.well these are my thoughts anyway.\nReply\nLiz U\nApril 15, 2009 at 8:57 pm\nIn theory I can see some merit in this, to help children become more educated about food and exercise.\nIn practise however I think the psychological damage it may do some children would far outweigh the benefits of such a program.\nThe teasing and bullying that goes on already in schools isn\u2019t completely able to be managed now, I feel this may give more negative feedback to children.\nFat kids know they are fat, they don\u2019t need to be weighed to be told that.\nI have a friend whose son is fat, he knows it and has been bullied at school because of it.\nOne day (after reading Craig\u2019s book I had a better idea of how to approach her on the topic) I did talk to her about how she could help him, instead of managing the bullying problem through the school, look at giving her son the information he needs to start losing weight (she is unable to help him too much and he is 11 years old).\nShe has lined him up with my PT (who is great and has kids of her own) and she\u2019ll keep him moving in the right direction, and he\u2019s also shown an interest in a couple of sports so hopefully he\u2019ll start to see a change soon!\nHe also loves the feedback he has been getting from our PT so it\u2019s starting to work.\nSo after that rant, I can see the pluses but then I can see the problems too, I think it would be better to be run maybe through the school but not as a compulsory school thing (maybe talk to the parents of overweight children) so there isn\u2019t such a stigma attached to it.\nSchool sucks, even when you aren\u2019t a fat kid \u2013 why make it harder than it already is.\nReply\nLiz U\nApril 15, 2009 at 8:59 pm\nAnd I agree with Ally, way too much tv watching and game playing/dvds.\nGo outside and get some fresh air and play like we did in the olden days!\nReply\nKimberly\nApril 15, 2009 at 9:00 pm\nIs it just me or do a lot of full figured kids have full figured parents.

I think her point was that she\u2019s not a fan. Far more damage to be done than benefit. I went to school with a kid who had a weight problem in his early high school years and he didn\u2019t need a school nurse looking over her glasses to know he had a problem. Even his friends, who loved him, called him Jumbo. He motivated himself without knowing what his BMI was and went from being called Jumbo to Muscles in 4 months.

My kids have always been slightly underweight anyway. For a good few years my son hardly ate a thing\u2026.which was a great worry to me as he was all bones. He was on meds for adhd and they can act like an appetite suppressant. He was 38kg 3 years ago and he has now just turned 16. (I seemed to be the only one worried about it though. One paed we saw told me to feed him icecream\u2026very useful!!! We don\u2019t see him any more.) He now eats fairly well (although vegies are a huge challenge lol) and is up around the 62kg at about 5\u20199\u2033 My daughter is also (slightly) underweight for her height but is very healthy. (she will eat her vegies) Both see a paediatrician\nand she is not worried about them.)\nNot too sure the weighing of kids in schools will change anything for them though as it is then up to the parents to do something about and will they??? Could we be starting a body image problem especially with the young girls. Will they be testing these kids every year and are we only talking primary?? (too many questions??\nsorry)\nOOh another day goes by and no arguments\u2026wow. Although my son is at his dad\u2019s and he is the one I most talk \u201cloudly\u201d with lol He will be home on Sunday. That is when the real challenge begins lol\nHugs\nChelle xxx\nReply\nPatricia Smith\nApril 15, 2009 at 9:41 pm\nHey Craig,From being not a school fatty but to being a fatty mummy myself later in life, I say,yes to the school weighing and measuring, but the information needs to go to the parents.\nThe parents are responsible for what the kids eat.\nI have recently lost 32kg\u2019s and in the process my son, has gone from the school yard fatty to a very thinned out and sporty young man. The only adjustments to his diet and lifestyle were the ones I made myself.\nI started eating properly, so did he, I started excercising on the weekends, they had to come with me.\nBut if you had of asked my 2 years ago, was my son fat, I would have said NO WAY, but to look back he really was. Get the parents more active and our kids wont be so fat.\nWhat do you think?\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 15, 2009 at 10:18 pm\nHi Craig,\nA new program has just been launched in New South Wales schools which allows students to register their physical activity, sports, dance etc over a certain period in order to receive a certificate (and perhaps prizes?) for themselves and their school.\nIt\u2019s a little like the Premier\u2019s Reading Challenge.\nI feel this is a far more positive approach than the big weigh-in. One should reward good efforts rather than humiliate children for poor performance.\nI would be very reluctant to support a school-based fitness assessment. As a parent, I want to be responsible for my children\u2019s health and wellbeing \u2013 not some clipboard weilding weight-Nazi.\nAs a teacher, I feel that we expect schools to solve all of society\u2019s problems and relieve parents of their rights and responsibilities in terms of their children\u2019s development. The obesity epidemic needs to be solved in the kitchen, not the classroom.\nLooking forward to hearing everyone else\u2019s thoughts on this topic too.\nEnjoy your Wednesday.\nEG xxx\nReply\nAsma\nApril 15, 2009 at 10:23 pm\nI think the education kids need to be given should be more than just what the food groups are and basic nutrition concepts, they need to be taught how to live healthily and what the right and wrong choices are, whether it be at school or at home.\nI wish someone helped me when I was an extremely overweight kid and taught me portion control.\nI think kids shoud be weighed and then there should be options for these kids to enrol in an after school program where they can be assisted to lose weight.

Don\u2019t think such a good idea, as a lot of kids big small short tall are already under extreme pressure at school without throwing this at them.\nI personally think that kids need more help focussing on posiitive things rather than what could be a very negative thing.\nA child who is happy, positive, enthusiastic etc probably wouldn\u2019t be self medicating.\nMaybe the people who earn the money should invest in their children, rather than MuckDonalds, playstation etc.\nKids are little people who should be treated with the same respect as big people and I am sure I haven\u2019t heard of compulsory weigh ins before work each day in either the public or private sector??!!\nMaybe that is the answer\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 16, 2009 at 6:41 am\nThey did this at my high school and I think middle school (10 years ago).\nIn the US \u2013 at least the State of Illinois (insert Blago joke here)physical education is a requirement and so once every semester we used to have to do the fitness assessment \u2013 how fast can you run the mile, how many pushups can you do, how many sit-ups, can you climb the rope, how many pull ups, how far can you sit and reach and yes they did weigh you and do a fat test (with calibers).\nEvery thing was in front of your phys ed class except for the weight and fat test \u2013 those were done private.\nAs a kid that was not in the greatest shape I never looked forward to these days, but it was never a surprise where people finished \u2013 you can tell who the fit kids are and who they aren\u2019t.\nYou pretty much already know who is going to come in last on the mile run and who is going to be done in less than 7 minutes (the track people, of course!).\nKids already know if they are fat or not fit so I don\u2019t see the harm either way.\nAs long as you aren\u2019t weighed in front of others and those numbers don\u2019t become public \u2013 it is a good way to keep track.\nI had a very nice phys ed teacher who wanted to work with the overweight kids and try to help them get more active \u2013 but I suppose this is easier to do in a small school such as mine \u2013 maybe larger schools are different.\nAll in all though \u2013 not a bad idea.~Cyn\nReply\nElaine\nApril 16, 2009 at 6:56 am\ni do not think children should be subjected to being weighed in school as this can start bullying, and what good would it do? we really have to re-educate everyone into to realising we are only killing ourselves and our children.Here in Scotland we have a massive problem too as i see children every day being given cakes and sweets before 8am, why ? I was a \u201cfat\u201d child and my life at school was hell and have recently lost over 13stones and it makes me angry when i see people feeding \u201ccrap\u201d yo their kids , the problem is in the home not at school\nReply\nNatalie\nApril 16, 2009 at 7:00 am\nI have a child with a high body mass because he is medicated for another condition.

A weigh in by itself is pointless, without a sound means of helping students combat less than desirable results.\nLast year I lost over 25 kilograms at weight watchers mainly by learning about portion size. As a child I was active and ate reasonably healthy meals and snacks, however I look back now and realise being overweight was mainly to do with the fact I was eating twice as much as I should have been. If I had been armed with this information 15 \u2013 20 years ago, potentially I wouldn\u2019t have been overweight for half of my life.\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 7:30 am\nHello Hot Cool Skinny Chick\n\u201cA kid can only eat the food the parent provides\u201d\nDon\u2019t under estimate how resourceful us fat kids can be when it comes to securing and consuming unauthorized food!

Thanks for your thoughts\nReply\nMon\nApril 16, 2009 at 7:32 am\nI think I\u2019m with the above teacher\u2019s comments on this one \u2013 a program that boosts kids self image and self esteem (no matter what their weight) would possibly do more good than a height/weight/bmi assessment. Perhaps if the initial assessment (offered as non-compulsory) was followed up with some self development (kids style) and a fitness program they (the government) might be on the right track. As parents and teachers we should be about empowering our kids (and not just academnically) so that they can realise their potential physically and psychologically.\nA bmi/height/weight assessment would only compound what they probably already believe about themselves \u2013 ie that they\u2019re not good enough. They might be kids \u2013 but let\u2019s get them \u2018thinking right\u2019 (about themselves) first \u2013 everyone always comments that kids are \u2018like sponges\u2019 and can learn anything \u2013 so I say let\u2019s fill them up with some positive thoughts about themselves. A weight/height/bmi assessment is really useless unless it is followed or preceded by some life skills and self empowering beliefs (once again kid style). Our school is pretty good with all that kind of thing, so perhaps it would all come down to how individual schools (and principals) handled and introduced the program. Anyhow, that\u2019s my thoughts\u2026.oh and I\u2019m all for increased physical activity during their day\u2026we have a walking/wheeling day in our school week where all the kids are encouraged to walk or ride. They get stickers and merit points each week for doing so\u2026no one even notices their getting exercise..they\u2019re just having fun.\nOkay, I\u2019m off\u2026.I feel I could go on, but I\u2019d better stop there ! cheers,Mon ( )PS Well I\u2019ll just say one more thing \u2013 it\u2019s the parents not school communities who are responsible for their kids health.

I hated myself and my appearance so much growing up, and it was entirely because of my weight. I already knew I was fat, but until Grade 5 (school weigh in), I didn\u2019t care about it, because I was happy. And it wasn\u2019t until Grade 12 that I was confident enough in who I was, and unhappy enough with what I looked like, that I could commit myself to losing weight.\nIf a child is fat, they know it. Unless a child wants to change, you can\u2019t make them. Full stop. And saying to a 14 year-old girl, \u201cWe need to do something about your weight\u201d, is a soul-destroying action, particularly if they aren\u2019t \u2018ready\u2019 for the change.\nI think it\u2019s much, much more important that schools focus on nutrition and fitness \u2014 health! \u2014 instead. If I\u2019d been given the opportunity to \u2018explore new foods\u2019 or \u2018let\u2019s go\u2026(insert interesting activity)\u2019, I would have been much more likely to get involved\u2026rather than take the suggestion that I need to lose weight as a confirmation that I had no redeeming value.\nWhy not get kids to count calories for a week as part of a PE class? We all know KFC is bad for you, but there\u2019s a distinct difference in \u2018knowing\u2019 (e.g. I \u2018know\u2019 how to pick a lock! Can I do it in real life? Pfft, no.) and\nthinking \u2018actually, if I\u2019m allowed x number per day and it takes up that many, it\u2019s actually a lot.

My new one coming out soon is \u201cTracey Binns is Lost\u201d and is all about childhood obesity, perceptions of it by adults and what happens when one adult, an over-the-top PE teacher, decides he\u2019s going to \u201cfix\u201d all these wussy fat kids.I\u2019ll be very interested to see the reactions to it.\nReply\nJ9\nApril 16, 2009 at 8:40 am\nHi Craig\nAt my son\u2019s school (he\u2019s in Year 9), they do beep tests, weigh and measure kids twice a year.\nI don\u2019t have a problem with it.\nThe results are fo the individual only to try and show improvement throughout the year.\nI don\u2019t have a problem with it \u2013 it\u2019s a reality of life to be compared and deal with it.\nI think we need to teach more about nutrition in schools \u2013 not just the food hierarchy thing but realy nutrition.\nThere\u2019s not much point targeting parents \u2013 most of us have instilled in us what we learnt and so few are willing to change.\nAs for yesterday, I snapped someones head off and then felt like crap.\nDid no good \u2013 in fact made things worse.\nMy own uncontrolled frustration.\nWill perservere today (and contact John).\nJ9 ()\nReply\nAndrew Devlin\nApril 16, 2009 at 8:41 am\nI am a PDHPE teacher at a school in Sydney. We do fitness testing every year on the students. We have noticed an increase in the average body mass of students from 12 \u2013 16 yrs old has increased by 5kg in the last 20 years. I feel this is totally unacceptable.

You've just sent me straight back to school & in grade 3 (I think) I was always waaaaaay taller than the other kids, stocky in a half polynesian, dutch kid kinda way & I would weigh the heaviest! AND to top it all off, we had a graph chart & I was the lone star at the top of it. It was most embarrassing to see that & to be thought of as fat & heavy. I look back at my school pics & I really wasnt even that fat\u2026 just a head above the rest.By the way, I was never even teased for being fat, so I guess I was just big\u2026. amazon girl\u2026..must have scared the little boys. hee heeOh the memories\u2026.So ummmm\u2026.. perhaps a note to all parents about obesity in kids & they can weight them themselves. If the chubby cherubs are still fatty boombahs in 6 months time, perhaps a word to the parents & a secret weigh in? I dunno. I'm not a parent & my nephews (3 of them under 10) are great with their health & exercise.Might go eat a donut now\u2026. mmmm\u2026. donut!! ha ha Just kidding.;-pPetxoxo\nPS YIPPEE!!

Are we opening the way for more to have bulimia and anorexia as well as image problems?\nLife can be hard for kids, would we be making it easier or harder still for them?\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 16, 2009 at 10:39 am\nok \u2013 not lurkin todaythis made me think about a past post of yrs where the mother insisted her son was \u2018big boned\u2019 and not overweight as you suggested. i think alot of parents are in denial and school might be the only place you can access them to inform and educat e and beat them around the head with cold hard facts. im always amazed at shopping centre foodcourts at whole families who are ENORMOUS including the school age kids. i think political correctness is holding this issue back.

In these hard economic times, and for those who are really feeling it, the budget only goes so far and when it comes to food, it is what is filling, rather than what is nutritious, which becomes important.\nI think a \u2018weigh in\u2019 at school would only be detrimental in the long run, wrongly encouraging kids to focus on their body image (they have enough outside pressure as it is without having it dictated to them through a weigh in at school).\nAs others have stated, let\u2019s focus on physical activities that encourage kids to get up off their bums and get interested in something other than the TV.\nI have a daughter (now 26) who was anorexic in her early teens, due to bullying, depression and bad body image. I can\u2019t begin to imagine how a \u2018weigh in\u2019 would have affected her.\nSo hopefully common sense will prevail and someone will come up with a way to get kids involved in physical activity without focussing on weight, but rather on having fun at the same time.\nDianne\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 16, 2009 at 11:02 am\nHi Craig,\nA very interesting article! I too was an overweight teenager.I piled on all the weight after I stopped all my sport when entering highschool due to my bad habits of consuming junk food after exercising, the cravings didn\u2019t stop just because I stopped sport!! My mother who was naturally slim her whole life used to try and tell me not to eat too much or the wrong foods but in the end we all find ways to sneak it!! As an adult I have managed to get my weight into submission through proper eating and exercise \u2013 some of my friends would argue that I\u2019m a little too obssessive but hey you turn your back for a short time and boy can some damage be done!! ( By the way I loved your book Fattitude !)\nI am a parent to a gorgeous girl who just turned 11, and and a boy nearly 10, and try to set a good example for eating right and exercise and have to admit that I fight an uphill battle everyday!\nThe biggest influence over our kids I find are their friends, my daughter hangs out with two girls who are both overweight and have no interest in exercise ( one she played netball with last year that could barely last one quarter of slow running around the court!) and as such through their constant bagging of my daughters\u2019 diet and love of sport, have noticed that she is constantly trying to get out of sport and constantly questions me about why I make her eat what I do, such as can you believe it\nSALAD!!!?? My son hangs out with boys that just run around all day and just burn energy at an insane rate \u2013 they don\u2019t have time to eat!! And just wolfs down what ever I put down in front of him.\nMy point is, in a long winded manner is , that I don\u2019t think weighing and measuring would accomplish much without a lot of effort going into educating the parents about nutrition first, and then in turn teaching kids about nutrition. I look in absolute horror at some of the things parents give their kids to eat with out even realising the damage! Just go to your local pool / rec centre after a swinmming lesson and look at all those hot chips walking out the door!! At the junior footy/ soccer/ netball what is everyone eating ?? Pies, sausage rolls, lollies at half time because oranges are too expensive now\n\u2026. what are we thinking!!\nFinally I think exercise should be done everyday whether as a family, walk on the beach, walk in the park, etc. Or take up a sport that you can do with your kids, you are already going there and waiting so why not join in?? My husband and I have taken up taekwondo with our kids and we love it, we really aren\u2019t that good but the kids love seeing us there with them, and I notice even the teens with their parents just love the common ground they share! It\u2019s not that hard!\nReply\nAnonymous\nApril 16, 2009 at 12:24 pm\nActually Craig Im doing surprisingly well \u2013 its weird \u2013 so much has happened but im still here \u2013 must admit adreneline wore off big time last few weeks and it hasn\u2019t been easy but nothing seems to phase me \u2013 I mean come on what else can happen!! and the break up with the bf thing was a long time coming just not great timing \u2013 perhaps we can schedule that catch up. lots to tell xx Hellen the sooty lurkercan I just say too that everyone\u2019s support here made me feel SO awesome that first week. the long haul\u2019s a bit daunting but there are some amazing people out there.\nReply\nTina\nApril 16, 2009 at 12:28 pm\nHey Craig ! I have a beautiful 14 yr old granddaughter who is\u2026 fat. She plays more sport than my skinny grandkids (which is a lot) and is extremely good at it. In fact, two years in a row, she\u2019s won a sports scholarship at high school. She\u2019s immensely popular and well respected, she\u2019s form captain, she has more friends than I\u2019ve had in a lifetime, she has a wonderful personality and is an all round great kid. She is a big girl, as in tall, and she knows she is overweight, but it doesn\u2019t seem to worry her. She eats good food\u2026 but too much of it. With the amount of activity in her life though, it still surprises me that she is so big. Her Mum (my daughter) has never been fat, and her little sister doesn\u2019t have weight problems. Her father\u2019s side of the family aren\u2019t skinny, but they\u2019re not obese either.

Kids (and some uneducated grandmothers) can be cruel and judgemental. We can tell by looking at each other if we\u2019re over weight, we dont need to know the number.\nIf I found out this was happening, I would fail horribly at that whole \u2018lets not argue for 28 days\u2019 thing!! I would not be happy.\nOh and on that note\u2026\nI havent argued with a soul since I last posted, not even the snooty,hair flickin, food spittin\u2019 16 year old.\nYay me!.\nCheers\nSorry, its epic.\nx\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 2:55 pm\nCheers Dianne ( )\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 2:57 pm\nHi Anon Taekwondo Mum \u2013 thanks for stopping by and keep up the good work\u2026\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 2:59 pm\nJust Email me when you\u2019re ready Hellen and we\u2019ll organise that catch up\n( )\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 3:00 pm\nYou mean you don\u2019t Tina?

This had it\u2019s biggest impact in that I didn\u2019t want to join in activities and sport because I felt like I\u2019d be letting everyone else in the team down. This went right through high school as well.\nI am obese now but losing it (painfully slowly but losing it) and my whole focus with my health is how to set the best possible example for my daughter.\nBeing active, eating right and demonstrating those basic healthy living skills to her is my job as parent and that\u2019s what i do.\nAs for weighing in schools, I feel that it\u2019s better to have a system in place where every child has to go and see their GP at regular intervals that continues after the age of 4, where they can get weighed and measured and if there is any concern the child, the parent and their GP can work together to resolve any issues there may be.\nThis is what I will do with my daughter regardless as i feel that\u2019s the best way to get help with any problems and the only way to keep it clinical, personal and the least traumatic.\nHaving a better balance of activity and education in school is beneficial to everyone, kids find it easier to concentrate and teachers have better focused kids so having wider ranging not only fitness but activity programs in school would have to be a good thing, some kids don\u2019t do well with the team thing, some don\u2019t do well with sport, but there is so much more to healthy activity than just these things.\nSomeone mentioned an activity challenge (like the premiers reading challenge) and that would be perfect for kids like I was, being able to make more of an individual effort earlier on may have meant that as a healthier teenager team sport wouldn\u2019t have been such a daunting thing.\nTo sum up-Activity- home and school thing.\nHealth and weight- home and doctors thing.\nCJ\nReply\nCJisFINDINGit\nApril 16, 2009 at 4:46 pm\nPS Society is bombarded enough by WEIGHT, I know this because my husbands 8yo nephew the other day came to the dining table saying he would like a FAT BLASTER (or some new fad in exercise machines, can\u2019t remember the name) for his next birthday, when asked why he replied because he was fat.\nThe kids a toothpick, but he religiously watches biggest loser with his mum every night and hears constantly about his mum and nan\u2019s most recent diet fad.\nThe kid is not healthy (too much technology, not enough activity), but there is no way he should be thinking he\u2019s fat.\nHis mum laughing and thinking it was cute is another matter.\nsorry, just had to get that out.\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 5:13 pm\nHi Gail.\nCheesecake!\nIs tomorrow okay?\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 5:15 pm\nThanks for your thoughts CJ\u2026 ( )\nReply\nPip\nApril 16, 2009 at 6:24 pm\nWOW Craig!\nThe RYL in Yanchep sounds very cool!\nWill let ya know about this very soon!!!\nI remember getting weighed in school once, \u2013 in form one as they call it in NZ.\nI had just turned 12 then.\nAt that stage I remember feeling quite proud of myself, \u2013 7 and a half stone whatever that is in kilos, (about 48kg I think) and 157cm tall.\nI was relatively slim and tall then for my age.\nI felt for the heavier kids though!\nReply\nCraig Harper\nApril 16, 2009 at 10:39 pm\nBe great to see you there Pip..

We are diners dedicated to seeking and devouring the food uncommon, cuisine exotic and entr\u00e9es less ordered.\nHave an open appetite and get ready to plunge into...the Deep End.\nFollow Me To The Deep End!!\nTweet\nJun 28, 2007\nIn Other News...Apple Introduces the iTaco.\nIt\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever experienced.\nIn my opinion, there are simply not enough superlatives in the English language to adequately praise this handheld miracle.\nAlthough there is one word sufficient to describe its attainability: difficult.\nEver since I first heard about it, I\u2019ve been driving around LA trying to figure out what location would be the best place to get one.\nI didn\u2019t want to camp out for one like some kind of Star Wars fanboy.\nI definitely didn\u2019t want to get myself into an online bidding war over one.\nAfter a little bit of pounding the keyboard, I\u2019d find my source.\nIt was a trek but all holy grails involve traveling and some suffering.\nAt least I had steel-belted radials and air-conditioning, those Hobbits only had their hairy feet. While many people I know will be gnashing teeth and biting fingernails in high anxiety waiting for their chance at scoring the Swiss Army knife of cell phones, the Apple iPhone, I, on the blissful other hand, will be lounging on a warm, breezy Santa Barbara beach, sipping a margarita on the rocks (no salt) and eating an equally hard to get item (at least it is in the authentic taco world).\nWhat am I waggishly referring to?\nThe eye taco, of course, or taco de ojo.Lilly\u2019s Taqueria, near Santa Barbara\u2019s rustic yet fashionable downtown, will be my version of an Apple Store come iPhone release day.\nMy reason for driving almost 80 miles to Santa Barbara for a taco is simple\u2014nobody else does eyeball taco in LA.\nThe only other city I know of that hawks this snack that eyes you back is Chicago.\nAt Chi-Town\u2019s Maxwell Street Sunday market, there resides a vendor who sells goat eyeball tacos, Sundays only.\nWhat a lonely taco vendor he must be.\nAs much as I\u2019d love to spend a weekend in Chicago, I simply can\u2019t make that trip, so it\u2019s off to Santa Barbara.Lilly\u2019s tacos are cooked al vapor or steamed.\nWhen it comes to meats, they specialize in the bits I get all tingly over like the entire cow\u2019s head.\nThe cooks steam the whole head of a cow and then, after it\u2019s done, remove various portions from it, like\u2014the cabeza (head meat), lengua (tongue) and ojo (eye).\nAfter a part is removed, it is then saut\u00e9ed on a flat grill and tossed with spices and finally nestled into an aromatic steamed corn tortilla.Unlike many of LA\u2019s taquerias, Lilly\u2019s only makes and moves tacos and sells nothing else.\nNo burritos.\nNo enchiladas.\nJust tacos and assorted beverages.\nLilly\u2019s is the In-N-Out Burger of taquerias.\nPlus, they focus on tacos al vapor.\nThis tiny eatery is deliciously specialized and the flavor of its tacos is the proof.I know what you\u2019re thinking.\n\u201cEyeball taco?\nThat\u2019s a huge burden of proof,\u201d you ponder while holding back the puke in your mouth so it doesn\u2019t project all over your brand new iPhone.\nI understand, but what you need to do first is let go of that instamatic visual of a bloodshot orb the size of a racquetball from your mind.\nThe ojo (eye) taco doesn\u2019t resemble a cow\u2019s eye in the least.\n(Believe me, I was hoping for a bloodshot orb peering back at me as I ate.)\nOther than what I can guess were the \u201cwhites\u201d of the cow\u2019s eyes, those grayish-white chunks I saw in my ojo taco could be easily mistaken for plain fat.\nThis sclera or \u201cwhites of the eye\u201d is pretty juicy\u2014when combined with the eyeball\u2019s fat padding and surprising amount of eyeball flesh, the result can be extremely tender and creamy.\nI realize creamy is probably the last word you\u2019d expect to see when reading a description of a cow\u2019s eyeball, but it\u2019s true, at least when the eye is steamed and saut\u00e9ed.\nHowever, after the ojo taco is all seasoned with chili heat and put together into the tortilla, your entire perspective on cow eyes will change and you\u2019ll pronounce the eye taco as \u201cojo so good!\u201d\nOnce in your mouth, this beef eye will confuse you into believing that you are eating the most tender of braised meats when in fact you\u2019re reveling in pressure-cooked pupil.\nSo to all you iPhone zealots out there on Friday waiting in those PlayStation 3-esque lines (remember those?) for your chance to own the one phone to rule them all, just remember: Sure, you can do a lot with your iPhone, but can you eat one?\nHey, you like Apple?\nHow do you like them apples?Lilly\u2019s Taqueria310 Chapala Street (off the 101 Fwy)Santa Barbara, CA\n931017 days from 11AM to 9PM805.966.9180\nPosted by\nAlba\nat\n4:25 PM\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook\nTags:\neye,\niPhone,\ntaco\n8\ncomments:\nGustavo Arellano\nsaid...\nThat's it, Eddie--you've gone TOO FAR.

The challenge is compounded if the non-bass-playing\npartner only has a trumpet's three valves and his embouchure with which\nto create. Thus Rochester, NY-based trumpeter Paul Smoker should be\ncomplimented for sheer audacity. His double CD session of live, more than\n60-minute duets with either Dominic Duval or Ed Schuller shows what can\nhappen when two accomplished musicians strip down to the essentials and\ngo at it with no preconceived notions.\nNevertheless,\nwhat appears pacesetting and awe-inspiring when sitting a few feet from\na performer in a live setting, reveals its flaws and shortcomings when\nexposed to the light of a laser. This is what happens throughout Duocity\nin Brass & Wood. Compounding the weakness is the hour plus running\ntime of each CD. Lacking the visuals and personal interaction, aural hard\nslogging can result with only three valves and four strings on show.\nThis\nis brought into starker focus when you compare Smoker's session with Duval's\nduet with reedist Mark Whitecage on Rules of Engagement. Not only does\nWhitecage divide his responses among clarinet, soprano and alto saxophones,\neach one of which is capable of creating more textures than a trumpet,\nbut the entire studio session doesn't wear out its welcome -- it's over\nin less than 44 minutes. Also, while the 11 trumpet-bass duets are instant\ncompositions, Duval wrote all the duo tunes on the other CD.\nPerforming\nfor the first time as a duo and with not many previous encounters under\ntheir respective belts, Smoker and Duval spend most of the time on the\nseven tracks playing slow-moving themes to determine each other's skills.\nIn the case of the trumpeter especially, this seems to involve extended\ntechniques that at time stray close to the show-offy.\nOn\n\"Burn Dialogue/Blue Monk,\" the nearly 131/2-minute longest track\nfor instance, he begins a cappella with a capricious display of growls\nand chromatic high-pitched note bending. Just before the solo threatens\nto turn into a Maynard Ferguson style extravaganza, it finally become\na hell-bent-for-leather dialogue between Smoker's chromatic trills and\nDuval's slower-paced, carefully emphasized arco work. As the bassist bows\naway the trumpeter decorates the output with shrill high notes and a line\nthat sounds like \"Cherokee\" played at a languid pace. There's\nno mistaking \"Blue Monk,\" which soon appears in proper cadence\nhere, replete with plunger trills. As Smoker dispenses his variations\non the theme, Duval counters with pealing, pizzicato strokes that offer\na sandpaper rough version of the same thing.\nOther\nthan a singing version of \"If I Were A Bell\" presented in a\nmuted Milesean fashion, the tunes concentrate on brass and bass effects.\nAt one point Smoker warbles offbeat slurring phrases as Duval introduces\nwell-modulated triple stops; at another four-string strums from the bassman\ncalls forth echoes that could come from an Alpine horn - then choked valve\nplunger work examination.\nFittingly,\nthe final tune is both abstract and conventional. Initially it resounds\nwith idiosyncratic brass note flurries that go from andante to adagio\nto allegro, as the bass line becomes excessively discordant. The ending\nhowever finds Smoker appropriately quoting \"The Party's Over\"\nin mid-register, Bobby Hackett-like fashion.\nOver-abundant\nexperimentation also characterizes the four Schuller/Smoker duets, with\nthe others leading up to and away from \"Hypnotics/Bassoptics Mutetics/Nostematics,\"\nan almost 31-minute tour de force. Separated by periods of silence and\napplause, the first section showcases legato trumpeting with thundering\nbass lines that get harder, stronger and more repetitive as Smoker shrilly\nwhistles from his mouthpiece. As Schuller strongarms a vamping ostinato\nback and forth, the trumpeter buzzes grit from his valves and soon broaches\nmouthpiece kisses, small smacks then squeals. Following a pause, a dark,\ndouble-stopping bass solo seems to invite Smoker's most idiosyncratic\nresponse as higher-pitched, Harmon-muted obbligatos share space with deeper\nopen tones. It almost appears as if he's playing two trumpets at once.\nAs Schuller continues to snap out short melodies and decorative asides\nthat then turn to a walking bass line, Smoker completes the showcase with\na flourish, producing a steady \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" buzz\nfrom his mute.\n\"Didgerotics,\"\nis the most interesting of the pieces -- not to mention the shortest --\nsince Smoker manages to produce basso didjeridoo and radung or metal Tibetan\nbass horn sounds from his axe, not to mention vocalized plunger inflections\nstraight out of the Bubber Miley Jungle book. Meanwhile Schuller moves\nfrom assured, low-pitched arco thrusts to split second visits to the effervescent\ncello register.\nTrumpet\nand or bass aficionados may get the most from these duets, a limitation\nyou don't have to ascribe to Rules of Engagement, though you can only\nget it at http://www.drimala.com.\nImprov\nassociates of more than 20 years, nowadays Duval and Whitecage often perform\nin trio formation with drummer Jay Rosen. That, of course, is when the\nbassist isn't busy with many of his other projects including sideman gigs\nwith pianist Cecil Taylor and multi-reedist Joe McPhee. Not that Whitecage,\nwhose experience as a multi-reedist goes back to the 1960s, has to take\na back seat to anyone. He's suitably expressive on each of his three horns\non different tracks here.\nTake\n\"Rainbows Were Over,\" which -- no surprise -- includes a recasting\nof the \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" melody. Beginning with blurting\nirregular tones from the alto that meet rasping, bowed arpeggios from\nthe bass, Whitecage soon digresses into husks of the original melody as\nDuval provide a unvarying swing foundation. When the saxist arches out\nshrill reconstructions -- speeding up and double-timing the theme -- Duval\nanswers with his own sonorous quotes, slowly sounding one note at a time.\n\"Snap\nJudgement\" is another alto feature for Whitecage's speech-like inflections,\nBird-like feints inside the horn and a bubbling, bluesy ending. True to\nthe title Duval constantly snaps his strings to such an extent that you\ncan savor his precise note placement as the tune moves from andante to\nallegro, finally settling into ringing pedal point accompaniment. Duval's\nbass work is brisk, however, as he strums with blurred fingering on \"Katherine's\nSong #4.\" A reverberating threnody, the piece revolves around melancholy\nexpressed by Whitecage's trilled soprano that extends barbed obbligatos\nwith intense vibratos. Examples of the reedman's cultivated, woody clarinet\nplaying are exhibited other places.\nThis\nis how the scorecard reads. Duval and Whitecage have created an altogether\nsatisfying session.

He's a lovely bloke and he got dealt with\nharshly by the press, because he bowled well for a\nTest debut on a very flat wicket.\" Broad recalled.\n\"He's come out fighting; he's bowled well so far in\nthis match, and we hope he can continue bowling\nwell for Notts - because he's been one of our main\nstrike bowlers in our run so far this\nseason.\"\nPattinson's\nambitions came into question again yesterday when\nreports surfaced from Down Under that he would\nprefer to play for Victoria this winter than tour\nwith England, if selected.\nHe and\nNottinghamshire quickly refuted those suggestions,\nhowever - and Broad confirmed: \"He's smiling and\nhe's still got international ambition. I'm sure\nhe'll be aiming for some winter tours or Champions Trophy.\"\nBroad himself had\na strange day - left out by England on the morning\nof the third Test at Edgbaston and rerouted to help\nNottinghamshire's title challenge.\nIt did not appear\nto bother him.\n\"Obviously it's a\nbit odd having a drive between games when they've\njust started.\" said the 22-year-old. \"But I did it\na bit last year, when I was 12th man for India,\nshooting up motorways and then bowling in the\nafternoons. It is something I'm kind of used to,\nand obviously it is very enjoyable to have bowled\nthem Durham out by the end of play and be\nin a very strong position.

It\nis located in Faridabad District. the city\nwas founded in 1607 by Shaikh Farid, treasurer\nof Jahangir, with the object of protecting\nthe highway which passed through the town.\nShaikh Farid built a fort, a tank and a mosque\nwhich are in ruins. Later, it becomes the\nheadquarters of a pargana which was held in\njagir by the Ballabgarh ruler. Faridabad became\n12th district of Haryana State on 15th August,\n1979.\nFaridabad\nis about 25 Kilometres south of Delhi at\n28deg 25' 16\" North Latitude and 77deg\n18' 28\" East Longitude. It is bounded\nby the National Capital Territory of Delhi\non its north, Gurgaon District on the west,\nand of Uttar Pradesh State on its east and\nsouth. Delhi-Mathura National Highway No.2\npasses through the centre of the district.\nIt has an Indian Railway station on the\nDelhi-Mathura double track broad-gauge line\nof the Central Railway.\nFaridabad is famous for Henna Production\non agriculture sector while tractors, motorcycles,\nswitch gears, refrigerators, shoes and tires\nare other famous industrial products of\nthe city. Badkhal Lake tourist complex,\nSuraj Kund Tourist Complex, Aravalli Golf\nClub, Raja Nahar Singh Palace and Dabchick\nare the famous tourist spots. For the ease\nof civil administration, Faridabad District\nis divided into five sub divisions, Faridabad,\nBallabgarh, Palwal, Hodal and Hathin. Each\nsubdivision is headed by a sub-divisional\nofficer. Recently Faridabad has been suffering\ndue to the departure of many manufacturing\ncompanies. Faridabad has seen Gurgaon and\nNoida speed ahead in development with lot\nof multinational companies setting up there.\nGeography:\nFaridabad City itself is a plain bordered by the\nRiver Yamuna to the east and Aravalli Hills towards\nthe west and south West. Being in close proximity\nto the Yamuna the land east of the National Highway\nis better in quality than the western side. Today\nvirtually all of the land has been filled up with\nresidential housing as the population of the city\nswelled during the mid 90s.\nMuch like the rest of India the people of Faridabad\nrely on ground water for their basic needs which\nis the gift of good monsoon season. In Faridabad\nmost of the population is Sikhs and Hindus and\nhaving lot of Gurudwaras & Temples. Among\nmain Gurudwaras includes Santo Ka Gurudwara, Singh Sabha, Pothi Mala and amongst temples Hanuman\nMandir, Shiv Mandir and Ghusain Ka Mandir.\nTransportation:\nIt includes everything\nstarting from an auto-rickshaw to the rich cars\nlike Maybach. Auto-rickshaws run mainly on national\nhighway connecting Delhi border and Ballabgarh.\nLikewise other means of transport are taxis, buses\netc. Personal cars and two-wheelers have gradually\nbeen increasing since recent years making the city\ncause of jams and traffic blocks. Trains stop at\nthree railway stations in Faridabad connecting Ballabgarh\nto New Delhi. Metro rail services are likely to\nreach the city by 2010 as proposed by Delhi\n", "index": [[296, 305], [372, 379], [396, 401], [420, 438], [499, 507], [728, 738], [746, 755], [780, 793], [816, 825], [858, 863], [951, 986], [1001, 1017], [1038, 1057], [1081, 1086], [1170, 1184], [1200, 1205], [1206, 1213], [1251, 1266], [1268, 1277], [1455, 1467], [1561, 1569], [1638, 1656], [1693, 1702], [1704, 1714], [1716, 1722], [1724, 1729], [1734, 1740], [1807, 1816], [1890, 1899], [1909, 1916], [1921, 1926], [2068, 2080], [2097, 2111], [2139, 2143], [2177, 2183], [2205, 2221], [2422, 2427], [2442, 2451], [2540, 2549], [2576, 2581], [2586, 2592], [2644, 2654], [2684, 2695], [2937, 2942], [2954, 2964], [3194, 3203], [3215, 3225], [3229, 3238], [3240, 3245], [3312, 3317]], "wikipedia_ids": [1180794, 14189, 14533, 3368837, 16294, 5798451, 1180794, 14189, 1180794, 51585, 37756, 3368867, 231623, 51585, 655887, 51585, 2746179, 697152, 1180794, 13409424, 213766, 3368837, 1180794, 5798451, 3677899, 5301848, 5794288, 1180794, 1180794, 3368867, 986046, 354286, 864789, 82759, 354286, 824124, 14533, 1180794, 1180794, 29405, 13677, 482849, 28871819, 51585, 5798451, 1180794, 5798451, 51585, 371350, 51585], "wikipedia_titles": ["Faridabad", "Haryana", "India", "Faridabad district", "Jahangir", "Ballabhgarh", "Faridabad", "Haryana", "Faridabad", "New Delhi", "Delhi", "Gurgaon district", "Uttar Pradesh", "New Delhi", "Indian Railways", "New Delhi", "Mathura district", "Central Railway zone", "Faridabad", "Badkhal Lake", "Little grebe", "Faridabad district", "Faridabad", "Ballabhgarh", "Palwal", "Hodal", "Hathin", "Faridabad", "Faridabad", "Gurgaon district", "Noida", "Yamuna", "Aravalli Range", "Western European Summer Time", "Yamuna", "National highways of India", "India", "Faridabad", "Faridabad", "Sikhs", "Hindus", "Gurdwara", "Singh Sabha Movement", "New Delhi", "Ballabhgarh", "Faridabad", "Ballabhgarh", "New Delhi", "Metro (British newspaper)", "New Delhi"]}

He went on to the University of Arkansas and played football under Coach Frank Broyles. As a 6-2, 210 tailback, he helped the Razorbacks become national champions in 1964. And by the time he graduated in 1965, they had won 22 games in a row.\nIn 1966, Lindsey was drafted in the second round by the Minnesota Vikings under Coach Norm Van Brocklin.\nBud Grant was hired to replace Van Brocklin in 1967 and Lindsey fit right in the new coach's system as a role player (backup running back and tight end) and soon became special team's captain on all the kicking plays.\nLindsey was a marginal offensive player for the Vikings, ever fearful he wouldn't make the team. He rushed for a total of 566 yards and six touchdowns, and received 65 passes for 632 yards and four touchdowns over seven seasons. But on special teams he was invaluable at breaking up wedges on kickoffs and covering punts.\nHaving played for Frank Broyles in college, Lindsey developed a deep appreciation of coaching. Throughout his seven years in pro football, Lindsey always assumed he would someday be a football coach, probably at the high school level somewhere in Arkansas or perhaps even back at his college alma mater.\nAs a second round draft pick back in 1966, Lindsey signed a three-year deal with the Vikings which paid an annual salary of $25,000 in the first year, $27,500 the second year and $30,000 the third year. He also received a signing bonus of $90.000. After taxes, the up-front cash bonus had been reduced to $60,000.\nLindsey was a small-town kid who majored in math in college. Instead of frittering away his fresh wad of cash on instant frills (cars, jewelry, etc.), he made a $60,000 down payment on a $167,000 chunk of Arkansas land.\nPayments on the land came out of his salary while he and his wife lived modestly in a rented apartment.\nThree years after purchasing the land, he sold it for $1.5 million.\nLindsey never did get into coaching, but he did start a real estate investment company in Fayetteville called Lindsey & Associates, plus he currently serves on the Board of Trustees at the University of Arkansas as chairman of the athletic committee.\nPresently, Lindsey owns 27,500 apartment units, 12,000 acres of farmland and 28 golf courses. Not including income from the apartment building operation (which is spread over the Ozarks to Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee), Lindsey & Associates did $800 million in sales last year.\nJerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, was also a member of the University of Arkansas football team at the same time as Lindsey. He and Lindsey are currently embarking on a five-year project to construct 5,000 apartment units, at a cost of $50 million, on 270 acres in the Dallas area.\nAnd the rich get richer once again.\nUnless you're born into it, money is hard to come by in this world, especially if you have to work for someone else. If you start your own business it's even harder because it requires a personal commitment, diligence and plenty of good luck along the way. And no matter how much effort you put into it, success is never guaranteed.\nSo if you suddenly acquire a large sum of cash, don't fritter it away on flashy goodies or get-rich-quick schemes -- invest it wisely in something worthwhile, such as real property or furthering your own enterprise.\nIf you define success by the size of your bankroll, you need to follow certain steps, starting with a long-term plan. Then be prepared to sacrifice personal luxury, remain persistent and have the patience to see it through.\nPersonally, I believe success is being content with everyday life, regardless of the surrounding insanity.\nI've solved all my money problems the easy way -- by not having very much of it; just enough to maintain a debt-free existence and never any extra money to fritter away on anything beyond the bare necessities of life.\nTo fritter or not to fritter, that is the question.\nBut it's only a dilemma if you have more money than you need.\n_\nQuote for the Day -- \"I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.\" Donald Trump\n_\nBret Burquest, author of four novels, has recently published THE REALITY OF THE ILLUSION OF REALITY (esoteric knowledge) and 1111 HAPPY TRAILS ROAD (humor) -- available on Amazon.

Dowd Award;\nMaine's Bangor Region Chamber of Commerce's Highest Award\nBy Dawn Gagnon, Bangor Daily News,\nMaineMcClatchy-Tribune Regional News\nJan. 21, 2010--BANGOR, Maine -- A couple who have given\ngenerously to area medical, educational and youth causes -- including a\n$2 million pledge to a cancer treatment center -- received the Bangor\nRegion Chamber of Commerce's most prestigious award Wednesday night\nduring the organization's annual awards dinner.\nDanny and Carla Lafayette of Hampden received the Norbert X.\nDowd Award in recognition of their contributions to Greater Bangor's\neconomy and quality of life during a sell-out event at the Bangor Civic Center. Chamber officials said Wednesday that the annual dinner\naudience of about 750 people was the largest in the Chamber's 99-year\nhistory.\nFor nearly three decades, the Lafayettes have been among the\nregion's most successful entrepreneurs.\nAs leaders in the hospitality business, the Lafayettes built\nan impressive chain of 27 hotels in Maine and beyond. Their Maine\nholdings include the Best Western Black Bear Inn & Conference\nCenter in Orono, the Bar Harbor Hotel and Bluenose Inn in Bar Harbor,\nthe Best Western Senator Inn and Spa in Augusta, and the Holi-day Inn\nby the Bay in Portland.\nThough the couple quietly had been sharing the proceeds of\ntheir hotels with the community for years, the $2 million pledge they\nmade to the Champion for the Cure campaign for the new cancer center\nlast August created a stir throughout northern and eastern Maine. In\nrecognition of the pledge, the new facility was named the Lafayette\nFamily Cancer Center. The state-of-the-art center adjacent to the\nCianchette Building in Brewer opened last month.\nThe new center replaced the former Cancer Care of Maine\nfacility, which had outgrown its former space at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor.\nFundraising continues for cancer research, however, with more\ninformation available online at www.championthecure.org.\nIn accepting the Chamber award, the couple said they were\nmotivated to act because their own family has been touched by cancer.\nOne of their sons, Ramsey, now 23, was diagnosed with cancer at age 18\nand has beaten the disease, they said during Wednesday's ceremony. They\nsaid they believe a cure will be found, and the an-swer lies in\nresearch.\n\"Danny and I and our family are very fortunate in that our son\nRamsey has now been cancer-free for five years,\" Carla Lafayette said\nupon receiving the award.\n\"Half of the people who receive the same diagnosis that he did\n-- stage three melanoma -- no longer are alive today. That sobering\nstatistic needs to change, and the key is research,\" she said.\n\"I envision a day when we share a characteristic with the\nnaked mole rat,\" which she said has been found never to develop cancer.\n\"I know that human beings are smart enough to figure out the causes of\nand cures for cancer. If the naked mole rat can get it right, we can.\nResearch is the key. The more scientists that we have tack-ling the\nproblem, the sooner solutions will be found.\"\nDuring his turn at the microphone, Danny Lafayette shared\nideas for making the region a better place in which to live and work --\nchief among them a state-sponsored medical school. He envisioned the\nschool as a joint venture of the University of Maine and the University of New England.\n\"About 70 percent of doctors practice within 100 miles of\nwhere they attend medical school,\" he said, adding that 44 states have\nstate-sponsored or private medical schools, 34 states have dental\nschools, 47 have at least one pharmacy school and 29 states have all\nthree. He applauded Husson University's recent addition of a pharmacy\nprogram.\n\"It's obvious that it's a good investment, and I have no idea\nwhy we don't have [a medical school] at the University of Maine. We\nshould bond it just like we do a road.\"\nOther award recipients honored Wednesday night were:\n-- Bangor Savings Bank, Business of the Year.\n-- Eastern Maine Medical Center, Not-for-profit of the Year.\n-- US Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, Catherine K. Lebowitz Public\nService Award.\n-- John I. Simpson, Bangor, Arthur Comstock Professional\nService Award.\n-- Hilda Hutchins McCollum, Bangor, Community Service Award.\n-- Mark Wellman and Tori Britton, Entrepreneurship Award.\n-- State Rep.

Taylor, MBA - http://www.kevintaylor.ws -\nKudos to Clark County School District\nPosted By Kevin S. Taylor, MBA On February 3, 2009 @ 9:40 pm In Community,Personal | 1 Comment\nAnother enlightening month of Leadership Las Vegas has opened my eyes to a few things that I believe everyone in the Southern Nevada community should be made aware of. Everyone seems to have an opinion on education. However, few people have the opportunity to view it from the inside out. That is exactly what Leadership Las Vegas Class of 2009 spent the month of January doing.\nOn the evening news we hear of sub-standard test data and other negative outcomes while school administrators and teachers struggle to meet the requirements of the infamous No Child Left Behind legislation. Very rarely do we hear of all the excellent programs provided by the Clark County School District (CCSD). Now, the problems are compounded by current financial crisis. Now, more than ever, the future of Nevada depend on public support.\nNevada State Senator Steven Horsford made a comment during a Leadership panel that suggested funding for schools was \u201cequitably divided\u201d among Nevada school districts. However, Clark County School District receives less money per student than any other district in the State. As a parent of 3 school-aged kids, I believe that the community needs to demand some answers from their local representatives in the State legislature. I am not seeing the equity.\nThese figures are not for the faint of heart. Clark County School District is the 5th largest school district in the entire nation. There are 311,240 students enrolled in 347 Clark County public schools. 7 new schools and 4 replacement schools opened in August of 2008. Currently, there are 18, 168 licensed teachers employed by CCSD \u2013 1,640 hired this year. The comparatively slim administration consists of 1,337 administrators and 12,013 support staff. There are a total of 38,611 CCSD employees.\nIt is important to also consider what the student population looks like. There are 110 languages spoken by students in Clark County schools. Some of these languages are only verbal, creating some additional challenges for educators. In a an average classroom of 33 students, 7 of them are learning the English language (ELL), 13 are living at or below poverty, 4 of them have learning differences requiring an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and 2 of them have been identified as gifted.\nThe newer \u2018prototype\u2019 high schools are built to accommodate 2,700 students but have had enrollment as high as 3,956 in recent years. Even in these conditions, teacher salaries start at $35,083 per year. It is important to note that these educators are, in many cases, top-notch teachers. 63% of CCSD teachers hold a graduate degree. Certainly, it is the desire to teach rather than the need for a progressive salary that motivates these individuals to show up at work each day. Clark County has a 96.4% attendance rate for these teachers.\nClark County Schools receives a meager $7,355 per student each year to fund the education of students through high school. The national, per student average is $8,380. Nevada spends almost 3 times this amount on convicted felons in the prison system ($22,000). This, to me, is a crime in itself. Are you calling your legislator yet?\nClark County School District is the home of 21 magnet programs for students with vocational interests, such as my daughter who is a junior at SECTA High School, one of the CCSD magnet schools. These magnet programs have helped keep some of the students in school \u2013 an important consideration knowing that the graduation rate for the class of 2006 was 63.8%. In 2007, only 3,639 graduating students had plans to go to college.\nSo, in addition to buying books and pencils, Clark County School District has an incredible amount to accomplish with the smallest per student paycheck in the state. Speaking of pencils, CCSD purchased 750,000 of them last year. They provided students a ride to and from school with 5,944 bus routes per day using a fleet of 1,267 buses.\nWith budget cuts affecting the bottom line, more and more each day, the CCSD must constantly ponder what services they can continue to provide and specifically which segments of the student population will lose out. There are federal mandates that stipulate certain things, like special education. This leaves \u2018extra\u2019 services especially vulnerable. These include things like the homework hot line which received 9,740 calls last year alone. Or, should safety be compromised? There are 143 school police and 177 nurses that keep our children and public property safe.\nBus drivers commute 20.9 miles each year while custodians clean 34 million square feet of school. The district provides free or reduced lunch to 127,557 students every day.\u00a0 This accounts for a substantial amount of the 27,593,400 cartons of milk that were served to CCSD students in the 2007-2008 school year. Yes, that figure is 27 million.\nContrary to popular belief, only 0.1% of the general fund comes from the federal government. 35.5% comes from Sales Tax, 31.7% comes from State Support Tax, and 28.3% comes from Property Tax. While it is my opinion that the State tax base needs serious help, it is only partially salient. Our local School District needs a way to generate income as long as the State of Nevada is not doing its part.\nOur Governor, Jim Gibbons, has suggested cutting education and reducing teacher salaries even more. I have accepted this as confirmation that he has completely lost his mind. Or, maybe he just does not understand the critical role of education in society. I hope that the legislators have more hope for the State of Nevada than our Governor. Call them, write them, let them know that this is not an acceptable option for the future of our children! And, while you are at it, stop a CCSD employee and let them know they are all doing a great job!\n1 Comment (Open | Close)\n1 Comment To \"Kudos to Clark County School District\"\n#1 Comment By Elaine Taylor On February 4, 2009 @ 9:29 am\nAs a retired teacher who taught 30 years in California and 5 years in a Charter School here in Clark County, you need to be aware that sharing the negative rather than the\npositive is the rule rather than the exception. Unfortunately negativity brings readership or viewers.\nIt is beyond my understanding how, in a society which is is supposed to provide world leadership, that we can pay millions to athletes, singers, and actors and actresses yet we pay peon wages to teachers and doctors who mold our children to be our new leaders. We have a totally messed up value system.\nGood teachers work their perverbial butts off and get little, if any, thanks for it, except for the letter or phone call from an irate parent complaining.\nIn California, the school supplied pencils, paper, glue, tissues, composition books, materials for art projects, poster board\u2026Here the families supply all those materials\u2026THERE SHOULD BE MONEY TO PAY TEACHERS A REASONIBLE SALARY. Want to know why Clark County can\u2019t get teachers? The year I came to Clark County I got credit for 4 or my 35 years on the payscale.\nIf we are to get and keep GOOD teachers, they need to be paid a decent salary and given credit for all their hard work. Teachers just don\u2019t teach. They write curriculum, design special programs, spend hours of UNPAID time grading papers and planning their next day, week, month and so much more.So wake up Gibbons, State Legislators\n", "index": [[296, 305], [372, 387], [576, 585], [807, 827], [910, 938], [940, 944], [1044, 1050], [1077, 1083], [1098, 1113], [1220, 1226], [1254, 1282], [1579, 1607], [1708, 1720], [1862, 1866], [2017, 2021], [2152, 2164], [2335, 2351], [2353, 2356], [2443, 2475], [2477, 2480], [2823, 2827], [3006, 3018], [3235, 3241], [3400, 3428], [3572, 3576], [3871, 3899], [4013, 4017], [4236, 4240], [4999, 5003], [5185, 5194], [5253, 5265], [5374, 5389], [5436, 5451], [5489, 5500], [5782, 5797], [6201, 6211], [6229, 6243], [6252, 6264], [6893, 6903], [7137, 7149], [7189, 7201], [7559, 7566], [7568, 7585]], "wikipedia_ids": [47737, 22216509, 47737, 512852, 1926056, 2819201, 22216509, 22216509, 13272531, 22216509, 1926056, 1926056, 48944, 1926056, 1926056, 48944, 8569916, 1555740, 2047289, 2047289, 1926056, 48944, 22216509, 1926056, 1926056, 1926056, 1926056, 1926056, 1926056, 296328, 373814, 339716, 21216, 414166, 21216, 5407, 40148490, 48944, 5407, 48944, 48944, 414166, 9504163], "wikipedia_titles": ["Las Vegas", "Southern Nevada", "Las Vegas", "No Child Left Behind Act", "Clark County School District", "Charleston County School District", "Southern Nevada", "Southern Nevada", "Steven Horsford", "Southern Nevada", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Clark County, Nevada", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Clark County, Nevada", "English language", "Ell", "Individualized Education Program", "Individualized Education Program", "Clark County School District", "Clark County, Nevada", "Southern Nevada", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Clark County School District", "Sales tax", "Property tax", "School district", "Nevada", "Jim Gibbons (American politician)", "Nevada", "California", "Charter school", "Clark County, Nevada", "California", "Clark County, Nevada", "Clark County, Nevada", "Jim Gibbons (American politician)", "State legislature"]}

But I did say\nthere has been a deliberate and concerted effort by those who were present to limit what has been revealed, allowing only a small amount of documents to be released under the Freedom of Information Act.\nI also asked her to read the book, which I said I believed was fair in its portrayal and assessment of how Lenihan and his taoiseach, Brian Cowen, had performed on that night and subsequently. She said she had read it but said no more about that, other than to say that at least Cowen is alive to defend himself.\nAs it happens Cowen has been unavailable to do so and is unwilling, as his predecessor Bertie Ahern has been, to defend his record in public. It all seems too raw for Cowen; he may still be in shock, much as he appears to have been when he was in office and as everything came tumbling down around him.\nO'Rourke is one of his fiercest critics. She was blunt about his shortcomings and failings in the recent two-part RT\u00c9 documentary Crisis: Inside the Cowen Government (to which I contributed). It seems likely that Cowen would have been greatly irritated by her and\nmany others (particularly Mary Hanafin) because of their contributions to that programme. Self-serving would be one way of describing them.\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s criticisms and viewing of the\nprogramme made me consider again whether\nI had been fair to Cowen and Lenihan in both my book and in my contributions to the documentary. In the latter I was dependent on the editing process of others, but the book, while involving the editing by others, remains very much my own responsibility. I stand by what I said in the documentary about Cowen because it sums up much of what is in the book: it is an appalling legacy to have been the taoiseach who oversaw the rushed introduction of the bank guarantee and to have surrendered economic sovereignty, as happened last November.\nHis performance prior to becoming taoiseach, during his time as finance minister, was appalling too. This is not hindsight: I wrote in April 2008, on his becoming leader of Fianna F\u00e1il, that he had an enormous amount to do to justify the garlands\nbeing thrown his way and that his performance as finance minister had not been impressive.\nI go into greater detail in the book, particularly about what others have told me about Cowen\u2019s behaviour while in office. The obvious manifestation of the psychological pressure he suffered was his drinking of alcohol. There is little doubt but that Cowen did not exhibit sufficient care about his drinking while in office. It may have been his way of releasing\npressure, but a middle-aged man with his responsibilities, excessive weight and previous health concerns (and the knowledge of the death of his father at the age of 51) should not have behaved as he did during a national crisis. He needed all\nhis wits about him at all times, not to be dealing with hangovers.\nBut what about Lenihan\u2019s performance? Lenihan should not and cannot be off-limits to legitimate examination of his record, but there is a danger that sympathy for his personal tragedy can lead to overly sympathetic examination of his record. His illness, once disclosed, could not be a private matter, not when he held a key position at one of the most important times in the history of the state.\nThe reality is that there were very serious concerns in both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance in the early months of 2010. Lenihan was unavailable because of treatment on many days when he was needed.\nCowen never moved against him, partly because of loyalty\n(and they remained loyal to each other until near the end of Cowen\u2019s leadership), partly because of a worry that the public might react negatively to the removal of a sick man as if it was callous rather than necessary, and\npartly because of the realisation\nLenihan had the communication skills that Cowen himself lacked.\nLenihan got a pass in some respects because he was\nlikeable and engaging. Journalists liked him because he would answer questions and be available to do so, unlike others. (You could argue that he played the media along, knowing that he would get it somewhat easier if he engaged with it.) Also he was not part of the government as a full minister until after the 2007 general election and did not get his first economic ministry until after Ahern\u2019s 2008 departure. He was a lawyer\nwho had to get up to speed quickly on economic and financial ministries,\nbut he cannot evade responsibility for the guarantee, the establishment of the disastrous NAMA (to which he was central), the failed and recurring recapitalisations of the banks and the ultimate surrender to the EU and IMF. And much of what he said about the economy \"turning the corner\" was nonsense.\nHe was unlucky in many respects \u2014 not just with his health but with the impact of outside events. I remember him getting furious with me in early November last year as I pressed him on soaring yields on Irish bonds, suggesting\nthis was the markets reacting to his policy of increased austerity, knowing\nit would not work. He blamed, and with some merit too, the uncertainty caused by comments made by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy that raised the possibility that sovereign states would be allowed to default on debts from 2013, making it almost impossible for Ireland to raise new loans on international markets.\nLenihan and Cowen found that their reward for doing all of that had been asked of them by the European Commission and ECB was to be hung out last November when it was decided that Ireland should be sacrificed for the greater good of the euro area. Knowing that it would finish them politically Cowen and Lenihan found the takeover but ultimately had to surrender. To a degree it is possible to feel sorry for them, and the knowledge of his failure was difficult for Lenihan in his final months.\nThe RT\u00c9 programme on Cowen\u2019s crisis was great drama, and had fantastic photos and footage upon which to draw, and, within the time constraints, was fair. I would argue that the story is bigger than can be told in two hours of television, and of course I would. But I believe that, by and large, any unfairness is coming from the former political colleagues of those under the microscope.\nThe Last Word with Matt Cooper is broadcast on 100-102 Today FM\n", "index": [[697, 710], [980, 983], [1045, 1058], [1131, 1138], [1793, 1819], [1928, 1935], [1955, 1966], [2100, 2105], [2148, 2153], [2221, 2233], [2301, 2306], [2437, 2445], [2650, 2655], [2727, 2739], [2942, 2947], [2952, 2959], [3226, 3231], [3890, 3895], [4053, 4058], [4490, 4497], [4513, 4520], [4938, 4965], [4974, 4995], [5025, 5032], [5103, 5108], [5221, 5226], [5418, 5425], [5460, 5465], [5482, 5489], [5924, 5929], [6127, 6131], [6249, 6251], [6256, 6259], [6542, 6547], [6740, 6753], [6758, 6773], [6904, 6911], [6957, 6964], [6969, 6974], [7051, 7070], [7075, 7078], [7137, 7144], [7251, 7256], [7261, 7268], [7423, 7430], [7473, 7478], [7859, 7870], [7895, 7903]], "wikipedia_ids": [287105, 427245, 22450394, 14560, 163152, 22450394, 287161, 287161, 287161, 3774806, 287161, 287105, 287161, 1027679, 287161, 22450394, 287161, 287161, 287161, 22450394, 22450394, 957729, 3204713, 22450394, 287161, 287161, 22450394, 287161, 22450394, 3774806, 1729032, 9317, 15251, 14560, 72671, 557007, 14560, 22450394, 287161, 9974, 9474, 14560, 287161, 22450394, 22450394, 287161, 1776826, 853120], "wikipedia_titles": ["Mary O'Rourke", "Virgin Media One", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Republic of Ireland", "Freedom of information laws by country", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Cowen", "Bertie Ahern", "Brian Cowen", "Mary O'Rourke", "Brian Cowen", "Mary Hanafin", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Department of the Taoiseach", "Department of Finance (Ireland)", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Bertie Ahern", "Nama people", "European Union", "International Monetary Fund", "Republic of Ireland", "Angela Merkel", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Republic of Ireland", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Cowen", "European Commission", "European Central Bank", "Republic of Ireland", "Brian Cowen", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Lenihan Jnr", "Brian Cowen", "Matt Cooper (Irish journalist)", "Today FM"]}

He was born Dec. 21, 1921.\nA pillar of the Estes Park community since 1947, Pep grew up in Peekskill, NY, attended Park College in Missouri. His education was interrupted by WWII. After Army Air Corps training in Yuma, Ariz., Pep became a B-17 pilot, flying 35 combat missions out of England with the 8th Air Force. 1st/Lt. Petrocine was awarded the prestigious Distinguishd Flying Cross for one of these missions. Though he had kept a detailed diary during these missions, few of his lifelong friends knew of this honor.\nBefore going overseas with the AA Corps during WWII, he married Cora \"Coke\" Altick on Dec. 11, 1943. He attended Colorado University in Boulder under the GI Bill, earning a degree in business. He worked one summer after WWII for Cheley Camps Boys Trails End, where his father-in-law, Ernie Altick, was one of the directors. Immediately after graduation, he moved to Estes Park, where he joined Jack Cheley and Altick in the purchase of Gooch Dry Goods store that had been part of Estes since 1914. From this partnership evolved Western Brands, Outdoor World and Rocky Mountain Connection, now the largest and among the oldest storefronts on Elkhorn Avenue. Pep started, in 1949, a very successful mail-order business to smooth out the seasonality of the Estes Park businesses year. All of these businesses still exist and have been successfully managed by his son, Ernie, for the past 19 years.\nThe legacy of Pep Petrocine is an indelible part of Estes Park history, having served as a trustee on the Estes Town Board for 12 years, during this time representing the town in the establishment of the Platte River Power Authority, now furnishing electrical power to five towns on the northern Front Range. He worked hard on a sign code and the redesigning of Estes Park before and after the 1982 flood. He was on the planning commission 14 years and chairman after the flood. He was always interested in having a quality presentation for the town of Estes Park. Pep also served a term as president of the Estes Park Chamber of Commerce. He was also active with the local Boy Scouts, and belonged to the Order of the Arrow.\nBankers attempting to establish a second bank in Estes Park approached this business and community leader to be an initial investor and board member, thus Pep served on the board of directors of the First National Bank of Estes Park for the next 40 years\nPep's passion for golf brought him the honor of being the very first president of the Estes Park Men's Golf Association. In the 1970s, this passion was replaced by tennis. He excelled at both sports, as he did in business. Back problems took him off the courts a few years ago and he had to again polish his ping-pong skills learned between bombing missions in WWII.\nHe played on the Estes Park Men's Basketball team in the early 1950s, competing with other Front Range teams.

Some characterizations of them are given in terms\nof univalent functions, Beltrami coefficients and quasisymmetric\nhomeomorphisms of the boundary of the unit disc.\nMay 1\nMitsuhiro Shishikura (Kyoto University\nand Fields Institute)\nTeichmuller contraction and renormalization\nAccording to Royden-Gardiner theorem, any holomorphic\nmapping between Teichmuller spaces does not expand the Teichmuller\ndistance. (Just like Schwarz-Pick theorem says that any holomorphic\nmapping between hyperbolic Riemann surfaces does not expand the\nPoincare metric.) In the theory of renormalizations, one often wants\nto show that the renormalization map (which is defined in a transcendental\nway) on the space of certain dynamical systems is hyperbolic or\ncontracting.\nTherefore Royden-Gardiner theorem is an obvious\ncandidate of tools to obtain the contraction. This idea was first\nused by Sullivan in his work on generalized Feigenbaum type renormalization.\nIn this talk, we will discuss two applications of Teichmuller\ntheory to renormalizations:\n1. Parabolic renormalization for parabolic fixed\npoints and their perturbations. 2. Rigidity of real quadratic\npolynomials only using Yoccoz's combinatorial a priori bounds.\nFor these cases, we deal with the Teichmuller\nspaces of a disk or a punctured disk and show that a certain inclusion\nmap induces a contraction in Teichmuller distance.\nApr. 17\nJeremy Kahn (SUNY Stony Brook / Fields Institute)\nThe complex a priori bounds, continued\nWe describe how to reduce the a priori bounds for\nbounded-primitive type renormalization to a simple combinatorial\nstatement regarding the combinatorial dynamics of arcs. We show\nhow the combinatorial statement follows from the expanding dynamics\non the Hubbard tree.\nApr. 10\nMary Rees (Liverpool)\nA fundamental domain for V_{3}.\nAbstract: We consider the space V_{n} of quadratic\nrational maps with one named critical point of period n, quotiented\nby M\\\"obius conjugacy preserving named critical points. Thus,\nthe space V_{1} is the space of all quadratic polynomials up to\naffine conjugacy. The parameter space V_{1} must be one of the most\nstudied in all dynamics. But V_{1} differs from most other parameter\nspaces in an important respect: there is a natural ``base map''\nand, within the Mandelbrot set, natural paths, up to a natural homotopy,\nto any other map in the Mandelbrot set. The simplest parameter space\nfor which this fails to be true is V_{3}.\nOne can say (truthfully) that there is no canonical\nchoice of fundamental domain for V_{3,m}, which is obtained from\nV_{3} by removing a natural dynamically defined puncture set.\nI shall exhibit a fundamental domain, using the dynamical planes\nof three maps within V_{3} and a theory known as the ``Resident's\nView''. This enables one to at least formulate an analogue of\nMLC for this family.\nThree parts of the fundamental domain are straightforward\n(although the proof in one of these cases is probably new). The\nstructure of the fourth part is much more interesting, involving\na spiral in the dynamical plane of the so-called ``aeroplane''\nquadratic polynomial z\\mapsto z^{2}+c for the (unique) real parameter\nc for which the critical point 0 has period 3.\nApr. 3\nMatilde Martinez (Fields Institute)\nMeasures on hyperbolic surface laminations\nWe will consider laminations by hyperbolic Riemann\nsurfaces, and different\nmeasures that can be associated with these objects (holonomy-invariant\nmeasures, harmonic measures, measures invariant under the geodesic\nand\nhorocycle flows). We will state some results that show how these\nmeasures\nare related. We will mainly focus on two families of examples: Riccati\nfoliations and Hilbert modular foliations.\nMar. 20\nPeter Makienko\nRemarks on Ruelle Operator, Invariant Differentials and invariant\nline fields problem.\nAbstract: TBA\nMar. 13th\n**12PM (Note special time**)\nSpecial Brown Bag Lunch Dynamical Systems\nSeminar\nDierk Schleicher (IU Bremen), Johannes Rueckert (IU\nBremen), Magnus Aspenberg (Fields), and Vladim Timorin\n(Stony Brook) + anyone who wants to can give input.\nCombinatorics of Rational maps\nMar. 6\nRoland Roeder (Fields)\nNewton's Method in two complex variables: Indeterminant points\nand the topology of basins of attraction\nThe equations x(x-1)=0, y^2+Bxy-y=0 are easy\nto solve, but the Newton Map\nN: C^2 \\rightarrow C^2 for finding the four roots has very complicated\ndynamics: N is four-to-one and N has points of indeterminacy.\nFurthermore, high iterates of N have many points of indeterminacy.\nBy restricting to parameters |1-B|>1, all of these points of\nindeterminacy are in the set X_l = Re(x) < 1/2, which is invariant\nunder N. If one wants to consider the homotopy type of a basin\nof attraction, W(r_i), for one of the roots r_i \\in X_l under\nN, one encounters a kind of ``topological indeterminacy.'' When\nstudying the homotopy type of a loop \\gamma in W(r_i), should\none consider the homotopies that hit the points of indeterminacy\nof N^k or should one avoid them? Both seem reasonable. To avoid\nsuch questions, one can perform blow-ups at the points of indeterminacy\nof all iterates of N, obtaining a new space X_l^\\infty from X_l\non which all iterates of N are defined.\nWe show how to make precise the notion of linking\nnumbers in X_l^\\infty, overcoming a different kind of indeterminacy\nthat is a result of the fact that H_2(X_l^\\infty) is infinitely\ngenerated. Having developed this technology, I will explain how\nwe can use it to study the homotopy type of the basins of attraction\nW(r_i) within X_l^\\infty.\nFeb. 27\nRobert Devaney (Boston University)\nRings around the McMullen Domain\nFeb. 13\nAndrzej Bis (University of Illinois\nat Chicago)\nDynamics of foliated spaces in codimension greater than one\nAbstract. Dynamics of foliated spaces can be characterized\nby the exceptional minimal sets and topological entropy. Dynamical\ntheory of codimension one foliations was developed by Hector, Cantwell\nand Conlon, and others. We present some results on exceptional minimal\nsets, which are analogous to the attractors in a standard dynamical\nsystem, of foliated spaces in codimension greater than one.\nFeb. 6\nYoel Feler (Fields Institute)\nHolomorphic endomorphisms of configuration spaces\nAbstract: The most traditional configuration space\nC(X,n) of a complex space X consists of all n point subsets (\"configurations\")\nQ in X.\nIf X carries an additional geometric structure, it may be taken\ninto account; say if X=CP^m or C^m, the space C(X,n;gp) of geometrically\ngeneric configurations consists of all n point configurations Q\nsuch that no hyperplane in X contains more than m points of Q. An\nautomorphism T of X (preserving an additional geometric structure,\nwhenever it is relevant) produces a holomorphic endomorphism f of\nthe configuration space via f(Q)=TQ. If the automorphism group Aut\nX is a complex Lie group, one may take T=T(Q) depending analytically\non a configuration Q and define the corresponding holomorphic endomorphism\nf by f(Q)=T(Q)Q. Such a map f is called tame. In the talk, we shall\nsee that for every non-hyperbolic Riemann surface X all \"non-degenerate\"\nholomorphic endomorphisms of configuration spaces C(X,n) are tame.\nTo some extent, this is true also for spaces of geometrically generic\nconfigurations.\nJan. 30\nTomoki Kawahira (Fields Institute)\nTessellation and Lyubich-Minsky laminations associated with quadratic\nmaps\nAbstract: In 1990s, M.Lyubich and Y.Minsky introduced\nthe hyperbolic 3-laminations associated with rational maps as an\nanalogue of the hyperbolic 3-manifolds associated with Kleinian\ngroups. In this talk I will present a new method to describe topological\nand combinatorial changes of laminations associated with hyperbolic-to-parabolic\ndegeneration of quadratic maps.\nThe method is based on tessellation of filled Julia sets, which\ngives a nice organization of the dynamics inside the filled Julia\nset like\nexternal rays outside.\nJan. 23\nDierk Schleicher (International\nUniversity Bremen)\nDynamics of transcendental entire functions from the point of\nview of polynomials\nAbstract: In this talk, we will discuss some fundamentals\nof iterated entire functions and indicate why and how they differ\nfrom polynomial dynamics, with a special focus on the simplest representatives\nin both cases, and a view towards generalization.\nJan. 16\nDmitrii V. Anosov (Steklov Mathematical\nInstitute)\nA lemma about families of epsilon pseudo-trajectories revisited\nIn hyperbolic dynamics there are results related\nto the existence of a true trajectory near an epsilon pseudo-trajectory\nfor sufficiently small epsilon (although, formally, some of these\nresults are expressed rather differently.) Many years ago I found\na lemma which covers most of these questions. The proof is rather\ninvolved and some famous mathematicians expressed complaints about\nthe difficulty. In this talk, I will present a simplified version\nof the proof.\nDec. 5\nViviane Baladi (Institut Mathematiques\nde Jussieu)\nAnisotropic spaces of distributions and dynamical zeta functions\nAbstract: (Joint work with M. Tsujii) The Ruelle\ntransfer operator is a powerful tool in ergodic theory, which involves\ncomposition with the dynamics. Many relevant dynamical systems are\nhyperbolic, i.e. they involve contracting and expanding directions.\nComposition with a contraction\nimproves regularity - but composing with an expanding map \"worsens\"\nregularity: It has been an open problem for many years to find a\nspace\nof distributions on which composition by a hyperbolic diffeomorphism\n(of finite smoothness) can be well understood. Last year we constructed\nsuch a space and estimated the essential spectral radius of the\ntransfer operator on this space. After recalling this result, we\nshall describe more recent progress including spectral interpretation\nof zeroes of dynamical determinants.\nNov. 28\nKristian Bjerklov (University\nof Toronto)\nThe dynamics of the quasi-periodic Schroedinger cocycle at the\nlowest energy of the spectrum\nAbstract: We will study properties of the quasi-periodic\nSchroedinger equation at the lowest energy of the spectrum. This\nwill lead us into the study of phase transitions. Moreover, we will\nanswer a question by M. Herman concerning the geometry of a certain\nminimal set - a non-chaotic strange atractor - of the projective\nSchroedinger cocycle. We study the case of large coupling constant\nand Diophantine frequency.\nNov. 25, 1:10 p.m.\n**Note: special day and time\nMitchell Feigenbaum (The Rockefeller\nUniversity)\nExponents in period doubling\nNov. 24, 1:10 p.m.\n**Note: special day and time\nYulij Ilyashenko (Cornell University)\nTopological properties of polynomial and analytic foliations\nAbstract: Geometrical study of holomorphic foliations\nof the complex plane, both projective and affine, lies on the boundary\nof differential equations, topology and complex analysis. Foliations\nof \\Bbb CP^2 have an algebraic origin: they are defined by polynomial\nvector fields, but their behavior is highly transcendental. Their\nproperties are drastically different from those of real polynomial\nvector fields. Properties of density of leaves, absolute rigidity\nand existence of a countable number of limit cycles were discovered\nby different authors in 60s and 70s. The talk will present these\nresults together with a survey of the further development and open\nproblems.\nFoliations of \\Bbb C^2 have an analytic origin: they are defined\nby analytic vector fields. Generic properties of these fields were\nstudied very recently. Yet genericity of density of leaves and existence\nof the infinite number of complex limit cycles is recently proved.\nMoreover, generic leaves of such foliations are either disks, or\ncylinders. These results are obtained by graduate students Firsova,\nKutuzova and Volk.\nNov. 21\nKonstantin Khanin (University of\nToronto)\nMinimizers for random Lagrangian systems\nAbstract: We shall discuss random Aubry-Mather theory\nand prove that for time-dependent random Lagrangian systems on compact\nmanifolds there exists a unique global minimizer. In the one-dimensional\ncase we show that the global minimizer corresponds to a hyperbolic\ninvariant measure for the random Lagrangian flow. We also discuss\ndynamical properties of shocks and show that their global structure\nis quite rigid and reflects the topology of the configuration manifold.\nNov. 14\n** talk at 4:10 p.m.\nIsrael Sigal (University of Toronto).\nSpectral Renormalization Group and Theory of Radiation\nAbstract: Non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics\ndescribes interaction of charged particles (electrons and nuclei)\nwith quantized electro-magnetic field (photons). The key problem\nhere is to describe emission and absorption of radiation by systems\nof matter such as atoms and molecules. In this talk I will present\nsome recent rigorous results on the problem of radiation and describe\na novel renormalization group technique used in proving these results.\nI will not assume any prior knowledge of quantum field theory or\nquantum mechanics.\nNov. 7\nMarco Martens (University of Groeningen)\nHenon renormalization (I)\nAbstract: This mini-course will introduce a renormalization\noperator for dissipative Henon-like maps. The fixed point of the\none-dimensional renormalization operator will also be a hyperbolic\nfixed point of the Henon-renormalization operator. This corresponds\nto universal geometrical properties of the Cantor attractor of infinitely\nrenormalizable Henon-like maps. However, the two-dimensional theory\nis richer than the unimodal case. In particular, the Cantor attractor\nis not rigid, does not lie on a smooth curve and generically does\nnot have bounded geometry. The quantitative aspects of these phenomena\nare controlled by the average Jacobian.\nThe global topological properties of finitely renormalizable Henon-like\nmaps in phase and parameter space are also controlled by the average\nJacobian. In particular, density of hyperbolicity will be discussed\nin a neighborhood of the infinitely renormalizable maps.\nOct. 31\nHans Koch (University of Texas,\nAustin)\nRenormalization of vector fields (I)\nAbstract: This mini-course covers some of the recent\ndevelopments in the renormalization of flows - mainly Hamiltonian\nflows and skew flows. After stating some of the problems and describing\nalternative approaches, we focus on the definition and basic properties\nof a single renormalization step. A second part deals with the construction\nof conjugacies and invariant tori, including shearless tori, and\nnon-differentiable tori for critical Hamiltonians. Then we discuss\nproperties related to the spectrum of the linearized renormalization\ntransformation, such as the accumulation rates for sequences of\nclosed orbits. The last part describes extensions from \"simple\"\nto Diophantine rotation vectors. This involves sequences of renormalization\ntransformations that are related to continued fractions expansions\nin one and more dimensions. Whenever appropriate, the discussion\nof details will be restricted to special cases where inessential\ntechnical complications can be avoided.\nOct. 24\nMichael Shub (U Toronto)\nLower bounds for the entropy in several families of dynamical\nsystems\nAbstract: Using soft techniques we prove lower bounds\nfor the maximum entropy of a system in a family in terms of the\nentropy of a random product of the systems in the family. We accomplish\nthis for two families of immersions of the circle. For one family\nthis is joint work with Leonel Robert and Enrique Pujals and the\nother Rafael de la Llave and Carles Simo. Time permitting we recall\na two dimensional analog whose entropy properties are still unknown,\nbut for which partial\nresults have been achieved in joint work with Francois Ledrappier,\nCarles Simo and Amie Wilkinson.\nOct. 17\nRobert MacKay (University of Warwick, UK)\nSome robustly mixing fluid flows\nAbstract: I suggest an example of a C^3 divergence-free\nvector field in a domain of R^3 with smooth boundary, vanishing\non the boundary, which is mixing and remains so for all small\nperturbations in this class. Two other candidates are also presented.\nOct. 10\nThankgiving holiday\nOct. 3\nCharles Pugh (UC Berkeley)\nSmoothing Topological Manifolds\nAbstract: The Cairns-Whitehead Smoothing Theorem\nis proved by dynamical systems methods, namely the Invariant Section\nTheorem.\nSept. 26\nRoland Roeder (Fields Institute)\nSuper-stable manifolds for Newton's methods in two complex\nvariables\nAbstract: While the equations x(x-1)=0, y^2+Bxy-y=0\nare easy to solve, the dynamics of the Newton map N(x,y) for finding\nthe four roots is quite complicated. In particular, N is many-to-one\nand N has points of indeterminacy.\nThe two vertical lines x=0 and x=1 are invariant under N and super-attracting.\nWithin these lines the ''circles'' Re(y) = 1/2 and Re(y) = (1-B)/2,\nrespectively, are hyperbolically repelling with multiplier 2.\nIn this talk we will prove that these circles have superstable\nmanifolds of real dimension 3 using the technique of holomorphic\nmotions. These manifolds extend to all points with Re(x) <\n1/2 and Re(x) > 1/2 respectively and provide insight into the\ntopology of the basins of attraction for the four roots.\nThis work follows the ideas of John H. Hubbard and Sebastien Krief.\nSep. 19\nM. Shishikura, Kyoto University\nRenormalization for irrationally indifferent fixed points of\nholomorphic maps\nAbstract: Indifferent fixed points of holomorphic\nmaps give rise to delicate problems such as linearization problems,\ndiscontinuous Julia sets etc. In this talk, we review the study\nof those phenomena from the renormalization point of view. We\ndefine a certain class of holomorphic maps with \"non-degenerate\"\nparabolic fixed points. The parabolic renormalizaion is defined\nfor this class and shown to leave the class invariant. Then the\nclass is still invariant under a small perturbation, therefore\nwe can handle irrationally indifferent fixed points with large\ncontinued fraction coefficients. This is a joint work with Hiroyuki\nInou.\nWe will compare this approach with Yoccoz's and McMullen's renormalizations.\nWe will also mention possible applications such as Buff-Cheritat's\nwork toward positive measure Julia\n", "index": [[1331, 1338], [2563, 2570], [2639, 2647], [2761, 2762], [3641, 3644], [4554, 4569], [4812, 4818], [4841, 4852], [5537, 5538], [5695, 5696], [6330, 6331], [6548, 6556], [7161, 7162], [7368, 7369], [7599, 7600], [7677, 7678], [7679, 7680], [7787, 7788], [7792, 7793], [8192, 8200], [8864, 8872], [10308, 10322], [10774, 10782], [11168, 11179], [11464, 11472], [12652, 12660], [12950, 12960], [13245, 13253], [13861, 13869], [14164, 14170], [14316, 14322], [14500, 14508], [14651, 14659], [14861, 14869], [14968, 14979], [15532, 15543], [16508, 16522], [16607, 16615], [17191, 17199], [17962, 17977], [18117, 18125], [18249, 18254], [18927, 18932]], "wikipedia_ids": [41980, 6674772, 556400, 18947, 12401563, 1346096, 10859, 251208, 21347693, 21347693, 21347693, 556400, 229160, 229160, 229160, 229160, 229160, 229160, 229160, 556400, 556400, 8564, 556400, 9109, 556400, 556400, 198566, 556400, 556400, 12216, 12216, 195351, 195351, 556400, 198319, 9109, 34750309, 556400, 556400, 6674772, 556400, 56434, 56434], "wikipedia_titles": ["Bernhard Riemann", "John H.

Yesterday's picture was of Mittie Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt's mother.Some information on Mittie:Martha, or \"Mittie\" as she was more commonly known, was born in Hartford\nwhere her mother (also Martha) was visiting a step-son and escaping the blazing\nsummer heat of the family's early home in Savannah. Mittie was initially raised\nin Savannah, but the family moved to Roswell when she was about five.\nRoswell, Georgia, located about about 20 minutes north of Atlanta, was and\nis the site of Bulloch Hall, the Bulloch Family estate. Mittie's southern roots,\nher two brothers fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, brought an\nadded dimension to the Roosevelt household. TR's father did not fight actively\nin the War, although he supported the Union war effort in many other ways,\nlargely, it is believed out of sensitivity to his wife's relatives. Mittie,\nsurreptitiously sent \"care packages\" of medicine and supplies to the southern\neffort. TR's mother, Mittie, and his first wife, Alice Lee died in the\nsame home, on the same day, a few hours apart. Mittie died of typhoid. This\ndouble tragedy, 2 days after the birth of his first child, also named Alice,\naffected TR greatly. At the time, TR was an Assemblyman in the State Legislature\nof New York State. He returned there for a few months and then made a temporary\ncareer and life change. Leaving his infant daughter in the capable hands of his\nolder sister Bamie, he headed west to Medora North Dakota and for a few years\nlived his life as a rancher.\nBoth the impact of TR's southern roots and his experiences after the\ntragedy of his mother's death, contributed to his understanding of the dynamics\nof Americans\n", "index": [[318, 326], [364, 383], [394, 402], [419, 431], [701, 717], [719, 737], [786, 792], [838, 846], [969, 977], [979, 985], [1010, 1018], [1044, 1051], [1077, 1084], [1086, 1093], [1135, 1142], [1167, 1179], [1208, 1214], [1265, 1276], [1288, 1297], [1333, 1342], [1354, 1356], [1396, 1399], [1427, 1432], [1532, 1538], [1626, 1628], [1639, 1645], [1736, 1742], [1851, 1853], [1876, 1878], [1905, 1922], [1926, 1940], [2209, 2211], [2342, 2351]], "wikipedia_ids": [3434750, 24113, 3434750, 211103, 3170957, 3170915, 3170957, 53678, 84493, 3170957, 84493, 110111, 110111, 48830, 3138, 3927857, 3170957, 7023, 863, 3170957, 30535, 863, 17626, 3170957, 30535, 3170957, 3170957, 30535, 30535, 425922, 673381, 30535, 3434750], "wikipedia_titles": ["United States", "President of the United States", "United States", "First lady", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Theodore Roosevelt Sr.", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Hartford, Connecticut", "Savannah, Georgia", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Savannah, Georgia", "Roswell, Georgia", "Roswell, Georgia", "Georgia (U.S. state)", "Atlanta", "Bulloch Hall", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Confederate States of America", "American Civil War", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Theodore Roosevelt", "American Civil War", "Trade union", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Theodore Roosevelt", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Martha Bulloch Roosevelt", "Theodore Roosevelt", "Theodore Roosevelt", "California State Legislature", "New York", "Theodore Roosevelt", "United States"]}

Full caseloads and busy schedules provide few opportunities for in-depth examinations of ethical dilemmas that often demand an on-the-spot decision. This article sets forth a pragmatic set of principles that can help counselors to evaluate ethically challenging situations. While these ethical principles are relevant to almost any counseling situation, this article focuses on how they apply to the treatment of substance and behavioral addictions.\nNumerous written codes of ethical conduct exist to guide the many different counseling professions. These documents may be more useful for giving clients and the public an assurance of the ethical parameters of professional behavior than in providing counselors with a useful frame of reference for dealing with day-to-day dilemmas. There is also an important difference between merely abiding by rules of conduct and embodying the ideals contained within them (Coale, 1998; Tjeltveit, 1999). A set of common principles derived from these various codes must be sufficiently broad enough to take into account the rich variety of practice settings, counseling theories and treatment approaches in which addiction counselors operate. Any less inclusive formula for determining whether a counselor's behavior is ethically appropriate requires knowledge of the context in which it occurs. For example, vigorously challenging a client's beliefs or behaviors may be ethically justifiable under one set of circumstances but not another (Tjeltveit, 1999). Similarly, different counselors may respond to an identical ethical dilemma in very distinct yet equally justifiable ways. What follows are six core ethical guidelines that are sufficiently broad and context-free to serve as a useful frame of reference in day-to-day counseling practice. These six guidelines are to provide informed consent; operate in a competent and theoretically sound manner; insure confidentiality of client information; maintain appropriate relationship boundaries; utilize adequate consultation; and to honor diverse personal and cultural values (Corey et al., 1998).\nInformed consent\nInformed consent is the fundamental bedrock of ethical practice, because it helps to solidify the client's autonomy in matters that affect the entire course and direction of counseling. Counselors may not always fully appreciate the lengths they must go to in order to ensure that important decisions about treatment issues are truly made from a basis of informed choice. Rather than being a one-time event, informed consent is an on-going collaborative effort between client and counselor for establishing and continuously monitoring the goals and strategies of counseling as well as the roles, rights, and responsibilities of all parties (Tjeltveit, 1999).\nA client has a right to know which treatment modalities an addiction counselor typically recommends, such as group therapy, couples therapy, family therapy, medication, support group attendance, and so forth. Counselors often don't take the time to explicitly discuss the expected benefits and potential risks of their services, as well as any alternative treatment approaches that may be available to the client. Informed consent also includes information about the anticipated duration of treatment and any situations that could result in a counselor prematurely terminating services. In addition, clients should know the policy for resolving disputes as well as all pertinent financial aspects of the counseling relationship; counselors should also be open to discussing their background and theoretical orientation (Houston-Vega and Nuehring, 1997). Due to the large volume this information may constitute, the counselor may choose to convey it by a combination of verbal and written means.\nA client's informed consent is not in itself sufficient to determine whether a counselor's behavior is ethical. It's conceivable that clients might be willing to give their approval to any number of ethically inappropriate behaviors, so a counselor needs other core principles to guide the ethical decision-making process.\nCompetence and established theory\nA counselor has an ethical responsibility to practice only within the scope of his or her professional competence. Some typical indicators of competence include education, experience, training, and certification (Pope and Vasquez, 1998). Competence in one clinical area doesn't necessarily translate to another. Counselors with extensive experience treating general psychiatric disorders aren't necessarily competent to meet the specific needs of addicted clients, just as addiction counselors without advanced training don't always adequately recognize signs of psychiatric disorders. Cross-referral between such specialists is necessary in such situations.\nOne often-overlooked component of competency is a counselor's ability to clearly describe the theoretical basis for providing a particular clinical service. Just because a client's case turned out all right doesn't necessarily justify a counselor's actions if they otherwise lack adequate theoretical support. It is important to do the right thing for the right reason, not just for the right result. Counselors operating without the benefit of a clear theory are likely to rely too much on a combination of intuition, habit, consensus and personal preference (Herring, 2001; Tjeltveit, 1999; Corey et al., 1998). Clients deserve the knowledge and right to accept or reject treatment that represents a particular theoretical orientation. In the absence of information to the contrary, clients will assume that whatever form of counseling they are receiving is the only available or appropriate choice.\nConfidentiality\nAnother core ethical principle is for a counselor to vigilantly guard against unauthorized disclosure of client information. The assurance of confidentiality is a fundamental guarantee, but it is not an absolute one. Several ethical dilemmas involving confidentiality commonly arise in the treatment of addictive disorders:\nDuty to Warn/Protect. It is widely accepted that counselors have a general obligation to warn or protect people whom a client places in imminent harm. The right to confidential treatment is therefore balanced by the need to ensure the safety of others. The beginning of the counseling relationship is the most appropriate time for a client to learn about these limits of confidentiality as well as any safeguards necessary to protect others, such as policies on notifying law enforcement personnel if a habitual DUI offender drives to a counseling appointment while apparently intoxicated.\nClients who inject drugs or engage in sexually risky behavior while chemically impaired may expose others to the risk of HIV infection. Courts have not generally applied duty-to-warn standards to these situations (Houston-Vega and Nuehring, 1997). Balancing the counselor-client relationship with the protection of at-risk populations is a very complex and emotionally charged situation.\nCounselors should inform clients about their policy for dealing with HIV-related confidentiality issues, educate clients about the health risks of their specific sex and drug practices, communicate any concerns that arise during the course of treatment, offer to help communicate information to partners, and consult with colleagues as deemed appropriate.\nMinors and Families. All states require counselors to report situations in which minors are in danger of harm, although specific state statutes differ (Corey et al., 1998). As most counselors know, it can be difficult to distinguish potential from probable risk. For instance, a client who admits to blackouts may deny that she places her children in any danger. A counselor who decides not to notify the designated reporting agency in such a situation should document the basis for this decision in the clinical record. Consultation in these situations is again extremely valuable in helping a counselor maintain much-needed clinical objectivity.\nCounselors who treat minors for substance use disorders need to clearly establish the extent to which parents have the right to information that is disclosed by their children. A minor may be reluctant to talk honestly if confidentiality boundaries are not clear, and the therapeutic alliance may be crippled if a counselor who is unclear on the limits of confidentiality later provides information to parents. Counselors should be familiar with federal law on confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse records for minor clients (Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records, 1998) as well as any applicable state laws, and should seek professional consultation whenever questions arise.\nA major ethical concern that arises when counseling couples or families is how to deal with the emergence of secrets that so often accompany addictive disorders. For example, consider the situation that could arise when providing marital counseling to a couple if a husband who attends a session by himself announces that he's relapsed on cocaine but is unwilling to admit this to his wife. A counselor who keeps this information secret is not fostering a climate of honesty. On the other hand, revealing information that a client reasonably presumed would remain confidential will damage that client's trust, while threatening to summarily end treatment if the client isn't honest with his spouse is a form of coercion and potential abandonment. This again points to the necessity of informed consent: whatever approach a counselor takes in response to these types of situations needs to be thoroughly discussed at the beginning of the counseling relationship so that all clients are aware of the consequences of disclosure (Corey et al., 1998; Herring, 2001).\nMaintaining appropriate boundaries\nThe next core concept of ethical counseling involves the complex area of maintaining appropriate professional boundaries. Most counselors know that there are ethical risks to developing relationships outside of the therapeutic role, such as counseling a friend or pursuing business or social interactions with clients. These types of dual relationships can impair a counselor's objectivity or unintentionally exploit a client's dependence (Pope and Vasquez, 1998). Yet some subtle boundary issues present ethical dilemmas that are neither obvious nor easily avoidable.\nCounselor self-disclosure. In order to maintain appropriate clarity of roles, a counselor should only reveal intimate personal information when doing so is clearly relevant to the client's treatment goals, carefully tailoring this information to the client and paying close attention to how such sharing affects the clinical relationship (Bloomgarden, 2000). Consultation with colleagues and supervisors can help insure that the true purpose for disclosing personal information is to meet the emotional needs of the client rather than the counselor. One helpful guideline is for a counselor to reveal information about a personal life problem only well after it has been resolved, and not while it is an ongoing issue (Hunter and Struve, 1998).\nTouch. Since a significant proportion of clients with addictive disorders have a history of childhood trauma (Briere, 1992), even a simple act of touch can convey a variety of ethically ambiguous messages. The history of addiction support is replete with reassuring hugs. It's very important for a counselor who engages in any form of physical contact with clients to have a highly developed sense of boundaries and an astute awareness of the clinical implications of this behavior. The initial stages of the therapeutic relationship may not provide sufficient emotional safety to ensure that a client can discuss any uncomfortable feelings involving the counselor's touch (Hunter and Struve, 1998).\nSexual attraction. Sexual involvement with a client constitutes a profound ethical violation with severe emotional consequences. However, occasional sexual feelings are not in themselves either unethical or even particularly abnormal in the context of an intimate therapeutic relationship (Pope and Vasquez, 1998). Counselors must acknowledge and appropriately process the existence of these feelings when they emerge in order to successfully understand and redirect them. The presence of intense preoccupation or sexual fantasies involving clients needs to be forthrightly discussed in consultation and supervision.\nRecovery Boundaries. Counselors who have successfully dealt with addictive disorders in their own lives can often relate to their clients with profound understanding, empathy, and clarity. However, they may also be overly devoted to the treatment approach they personally found successful (Johnson, 2000). For instance, counselors who are strongly 12-step oriented may discount non-abstinence models for addressing substance abuse, such as risk reduction strategies, which threatens to place clients into a one-size-fits-all philosophy of care.\nA counselor who is candid about being \"in recovery\" may give clients hope and reduce the shame that inevitably accompanies addiction. However, too much disclosure can be intrusive and distracting for some clients, and can even inadvertently generate unrealistic expectations or a sense of inadequacy (Bloomgarden, 2000). Counselors should therefore carefully reveal information about their personal addiction experience only in as much detail as is necessary to meet a compelling and clearly defined clinical need.\nA counselor who is treating clients with substance use disorders should not be unsuccessfully fighting the same battle. Sustained abstinence from addictive behavior is an inescapable ethical responsibility for anybody working in this field. Counselors with less than several years of recovery time may easily lose objectivity when dealing with clients whose clinical picture mirrors their own personal experience. Heightened levels of consultation and supervision are highly advisable in such circumstances.\nNobody is immune to relapse, regardless of the length of time in recovery. A counselor who reverts to a previous pattern of addictive behavior must face the ethical dilemma of whether to limit, suspend, or terminate clinical duties. Abruptly withdrawing services from a client due to this (or any other) form of counselor impairment is likely to be deeply disruptive to the client's healing process (Bissell and Royce, 1994). Clients in such situations must be given the opportunity to continue counseling with another provider. There is no one answer to the problem of counselor relapse that is completely satisfying. In this regard the difference between a temporary \"slip\" that can result in increased self-awareness and an unrestrained relapse may be useful in determining a counselor's overall level of clinical impairment. These decisions should be made in a process of supervision and consultation so that the counselor is not relying on his or her personal judgment, which may be impaired.\nAll counselors who are in recovery from addictive behavior must establish whatever safeguards are necessary to ensure the maintenance of a personal program of sobriety. This may include establishing boundaries around support group meetings that clients are asked not to attend. It is not ethically appropriate for counselors in 12-step recovery to sponsor their own patients or chair meetings where they are employed (Bissell and Royce, 1994).\nSupervision\nThe next core ethical concept is for counselors to have a structured process for discussing formulations, interventions, reactions, and inevitable difficulties with supervisors and colleagues. There is a heightened need for supervision and consultation for counselors who are working on the outer limits of either personal competence or established theory (Corey et al., 1998). For example, a counselor attempting to implement a new technique should utilize close supervision until it becomes fully integrated into his or her set of skills.\nIt's an unfortunate reality that not all clinical supervisors have adequate experience or knowledge in the treatment of addictive disorders. In such cases a counselor needs to seek out additional sources for case consultation.\nOne solution is to set up and utilize informal telephone and e-mail networks which can be established fairly easily with colleagues and contacts made through professional affiliations. When consultation is not available for discussing a clinical or ethical dilemma, a counselor should document in the clinical record a summary of the relevant issues as well as any action taken in response to it.\nHonoring diverse values\nAll of the preceding ethical principles involve some specific actions for a counselor to take. However, the ethical dimension of counseling goes far beyond merely abiding by a procedural checklist. An ethical counselor consistently demonstrates respect for the client as a person by honoring diversity and appreciating the degree to which his or her personal values influence the entire process of counseling. Since counselors are in the business of helping clients change some aspect of their lives, the great ethical challenge is to effectively guide the process and direction of this change without undermining the client's autonomy. This ethical use of a counselor's influence is a skill that cannot be taught as much as developed.\nSince every person's view of the world represents a unique combination of diverse personal and cultural perspectives, it is inevitable that counselors will sometimes hold views that are very different from their clients. No counselor is ethically justified in assuming that the way he or she views life is the way everybody else does, is the right way, or is the only way. However, some counselors act as if the way to avoid imposing their personal values is to simply not talk about them.\nBut biases don't lose their influence just because they're not discussed; in fact they often become less amenable to change. It is often more ethically beneficial for a counselor to invite discussion about his or her personal values while conveying an ability to respect and work with many alternative positions. A counselor doesn't need to be neutral about his or her values in order to be nonjudgmental (Coale, 1998; Tjeltveit, 1999).\nWhen a client and a counselor hold fundamentally incompatible value orientations, the counselor should either refer the case or strive to help the client achieve the goals of counseling within the context of the client's value system rather than attempting to change those values. If a counselor finds it necessary to attempt to modify a client's values, this should be done to no more extent than is necessary to address that client's particular focus of treatment.\nCounselors often avoid initiating discussion with clients about the ethical dimensions of clinical issues. Sometimes this reluctance stems from the fear of appearing moralistic, but it also reflects a general tendency of the counseling profession to be ethically inarticulate. It takes considerable effort and skill to engage in thoughtful dialogue about the ethical aspects of life, but doing so can have great benefit for clients whose history of addiction is marked by diminished personal integrity. While this does not guarantee a positive clinical outcome, it does foster the kind of therapeutic environment for a client to utilize the counseling experience to its fullest potential.\nThese guidelines are not an exhaustive review of every ethical issue related to addictions counseling and they cannot substitute for a counselor's knowledge of his or her professional code of conduct. Many clinical situations require a more detailed examination of the ethical issues involved or compliance with specific codified procedures, such as guidelines for research involving human subjects. Although counselors almost always operate within ethical parameters, these principles can serve as a helpful reminder of some of the important points to consider when evaluating the proper ethical stance to take when dealing with the many complexities of addictions counseling.\nBill Herring, LCSW, is a privately practicing clinician in Atlanta.

However the one delima thatsurpasses all others working with juvenile is confidentiality. Even though theysign consent forms for releaselof certain information it is very important to besure they understand what information they are consenting or authorizing to bereleased.\nTheir misunderstanding can damage the counselor client relationship\nReply\n0\u00a00\nAckson mwimbi\n-\u00a0This is an important aspect of the course\n|69.171.160.xxx\n|2012-02-25 04:29:03\nI dont think anyone should be allowed to practice or work in an addiction fieldwithout taking this course.\nReply\n0\u00a00\nMayra Schneider\n-\u00a0student\n|160.253.128.xxx\n|2012-02-24 06:00:06\nI thought it was very important what this article mentioned. That is, that\nnomatter how much time the client have been sober he or she can alwaysrelapse.\nAlso, especially when we deal with addictions because of the stigmais always important to keep confidentiality. And of course, before I startworking with the client, the client must sign a consent.\nReply\n0\u00a00\nCathy Duncan\n|69.138.75.xxx\n|2012-02-25 17:11:54\nAlso remember counselors can also relapse.\nWhen this happens that counselorwill need to work on their own soberity. In doing so that caseload-clients maynot receive the support they need from that counselor and shouls thatinformation be disclosed to a supervisor or kept confidential, what about theclient\nReply\n0\u00a00\nGwendolyn Jones\n|198.200.181.xxx\n|2011-02-23 05:44:43\nI'm glad that the ethical guidelines have focus on tough.\nWhile attending AA/NAmeetings, I always though that the \"hug\" thing was sometimes toopersonal. I'm glad that there are \"rules\" because some people areoffended and to gain good rapport from the very geginning I feel that\"space\" shows respect for both consumer and counselor.\nIn addition, theduty to warn/protect is a very tricky guideline in any situation.\nAs a goodcounselor you just have to face the fact that this guideline will benefiteveryone involved.\nFor example, if a client has revealed to you that he/sheuses hyperdemic needle that belong to a family member who has diabetes, to stopa possible infection of diseases, this should be reported to authorities.\nReply\n0\u00a00\nGwendolyn Jones\n-\u00a0Comments\n|198.200.181.xxx\n|2011-02-21 08:35:56\nAlthough I had a general idea of ethics for addiction treatment professionals, Ifound the article very informative.\nIt answered many questions that I hadconcerning \"what if\" situations.\nIn addition, the article was writtenwhereas I clearly understood the gidelines.\nReply\n0\u00a00\nJessica James\n|67.61.24.xxx\n|2010-09-25 15:53:07\nI found this article very helpful.

Few hours before, Indian Cricket team that was ready to come back leaving the Australian tour in the mid, is all set to play for 20-20 match in Melbourne .\nWe might witness a healthy tough competition between the two leading teams of the world. Thank God!\nThe racism charges against Harbhajan Singh had been dropped but he has to pay 50 per cent of match fees. Don\u2019t you think, this outcome was bound to happen and there was no other outcome possible? Ultimately,money rules over everything else. There is too much money at stake to cancel the tour both officially and unofficially A lot of money of the organizers, advertisers and sponsors could be saved due the decision of Indian team to play the one day series too.\nWe all know cricket is not only game but also a nice opportunity for corporate houses to advertise their products and services.nnterDefinitely, few people like me would not like to accept this judgment, it was Symonds who provoked Bhajji first then he should be the first one who should be punished (He should also give 50 percent of his match fee)! They are saying Bhajji is let off for his past good behavior, as if they are doing a favour to him and India.\nAlso the Australian team has proved the world that they are bunch of liars and cheats supported by Procter.No can one forget that India had defeated Australia in 20-20 match finals. Yes! We all Indian cricket enthusiastic are waiting for that magic again.

In fact business visits were the hardest hit, falling by 23% among UK residents travelling abroad on business, compared to 19% of overseas business travellers heading here to the UK.\nHoliday visits to relatives abroad by UK residents fell at a lower rate of 6.5% and to friends abroad at a higher 15%.\u00a0The number of overseas residents visiting the UK to see friends and family also dropped by 9.7%.\nONS reported that it is not all doom and gloom for some sectors of the UK though, as expenditure of overseas visitors during their UK holidays grew from \u00a316.3 billion in 2008 to \u00a316.6 billion last year in 2009, with UK residents\u2019 expenditure abroad falling by \u00a35.1 billion due to the current economic climate.\nThe number of overseas travellers visiting London during their stay here fell by 3.7% in 2009, with visits to Scotland rising slightly during this time.\u00a0Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham remain popular destinations for overseas visitors to the UK.\nThe most common reason for British residents travelling abroad is still for annual holidays.\u00a0They also dominate spending with \u00a321.8 billion of the \u00a331.7 billion total expenditure abroad in 2009 being for holiday purposes.\nThroughout 2009 Egypt, Jamaica and Lithuania received an increase in visits from UK residents, continuing the overall trend in recent years.\u00a0Mexico was exempt from this increase as visitors there dropped substantially by 41%.\nUK residents may be taking fewer beach holidays abroad but there has been a rise in the duration of holidays in recent years.\u00a0In 2007 the average stay was 9.9 nights rising to 10.2 nights in 2008 and even further to 10.5 nights in 2009.\nThis shows that although holidaymakers are cutting back on the amount of foreign trips they are taking, many are making up for this by increasing the time that they spend away on holiday.\nShare\nRSS\nMore\nShare\nMore\nChronicleLive Classifieds\nFind a new job\nFind a car\neasyAds123\nBook an Ad\nFind local business\nFind a home\nFind your dream date\nRemembrance\nChronicleLive, the Evening Chronicle newspaper online.

By 1825 the site had become part of a land grant to the Marquis de Lafayette.\nA small African-American community of farmers and plantation employees lived here in the late 1800s.\u00a0 Some owned their land, while others worked as tenant farmers raising crops to pay for their rent. Remnants of historic home sites may be seen on the Lake Overstreet property. In the early 1900s it was home to a quail plantation, combining small farms with hunting lands.\nNew York financier Alfred Barmore Maclay bought the land in 1923 and created this masterpiece of floral architecture for his family\u2019s southern retreat on the rolling hills overlooking picturesque Lake Hall. The Maclays entertained many prominent people here, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\nOriginally named Killearn Plantation and Gardens for his ancestral home in Scotland, it was later renamed Maclay Gardens to honor their creator. After Maclay\u2019s death in 1944 his wife, Louise Maclay, continued developing the gardens and in 1953 donated Killearn Gardens to the state.\nThe state of Florida acquired the Lake Overstreet property in 1994. The gardens and park were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 as Killearn Plantation Archeological and Historic District.\nThe Red Hills of Tallahassee are the setting for Maclay Gardens State Park. The topography is characterized by rolling hills and deep ravines.\u00a0 Eight distinct natural communities coexist with developed areas of the park.\nComments about: Alfred Maclay Gardens State Park\nHave a Question or Comment\n", "index": [[344, 355], [815, 819], [823, 825], [1280, 1289], [1335, 1350], [1825, 1834], [2597, 2608], [2612, 2623], [2624, 2631], [2715, 2731], [2812, 2832], [2842, 2858], [3085, 3100], [3207, 3215], [3403, 3412], [3418, 3425], [3480, 3484], [3489, 3507], [3550, 3557], [3584, 3592], [3805, 3812], [3826, 3841], [3900, 3936], [3986, 4003], [4009, 4018], [4022, 4033], [4294, 4301]], "wikipedia_ids": [57700, 86404, 3434750, 9488289, 9489583, 9488289, 57700, 73612, 18933066, 21217, 156068, 2154, 9489583, 645042, 9488289, 34097179, 8219053, 46854, 42139, 26994, 18933066, 9489583, 64065, 8708862, 4041208, 57700, 8592308], "wikipedia_titles": ["Tallahassee, Florida", "Interstate 10", "United States", "Lake Hall", "Lake Overstreet", "Lake Hall", "Tallahassee, Florida", "Leon County, Florida", "Florida", "Native Americans in the United States", "Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette", "African Americans", "Lake Overstreet", "New York City", "Lake Hall", "Maclay Murray & Spens", "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball", "Wallis Simpson", "Garden", "Scotland", "Florida", "Lake Overstreet", "National Register of Historic Places", "Historic districts in the United States", "Red Hills Region", "Tallahassee, Florida", "Comment (computer programming)"]}

Mesh (Aries), Brish (Taurus), Mithun (Gemini), Karkat (Cancer), Simha (Leo), Kanya (Virgo), Tula (Libra), Brishchik (Scorpio), Dhanu (Sagittarius), Makar (Capricorn), Kumbha (Aquarius) and Meen (Pisces) are the 12 signs of the zodiac, and in Nepali they are called Rashi.\nIn Nepal the moment a baby is born, the first thing they do is note down the exact time of birth. Then it is given to the astrologer, who according to the position of the different planets in the solar system at that precise moment prepares a Cheena (horoscope). Cheena is a rectangular chart, which indicates the degree of influence of the planets from the solar world on the people born to a particular Rashi. Besides highlighting the positive as well as negative aspects of one\u2019s life comprising of achievements and failures, when it comes to facing difficult times the Nepalese people go to their astrologer with their Cheena for consultations and they act according to his recommendations.\nAs an astrological document, Cheena, they say, pre-determines the entire course of an individual s life. For the Nepalese people on their birthday, the day is partly set aside to worship their planet that occupies a major position in their horoscope made according to the position of stars at the time of birth. It is also a day for them to please the other ones who are not placed in such a favourable position in their Cheena. As well on this day they also go through a number of rituals with their priest, who is offered grains and cash in order to stay in good health for the entire year. Astrologers are also consulted on various occasions like rice feeding, sacred thread and weddings.

This is an opportunity to potentially capture the next leg to the upside but may also set the stage for a decline that could last slightly longer.\u00a0What is important is that coming into next week the indices do not decline sharply and eradicate the recent gains.The FTSE 100 Index has so far remained above 5600, which is a positive sign that could lift the index higher towards the 5820 target. As long as the FTSE maintains a hold of this level the bulls are likely to remain in control. If the index does start trading below 5600, the next line of support could come in at 5585 \u2013 5535 and possibly as low as 5487. These areas could then see another move higher to clear 5820 and ultimately aim for the 6000 level.So far the German Dax has shown strength above 6200 and is also clearing past 6300 to test the October high of 6430. As long as we see the index remain above 6300, the resistance level of 6440 could see the Dax struggle and pull the Dax down towards the 6300 area. Once the index clears past 6440 the next target becomes 6720. This could prevent the index moving higher before seeing a significant correction. For now though the focus should be between the range of 6300 \u2013 6440.Heading into the afternoon session, the US Dow Jones should see mixed trading as it takes its cue from the European markets. The Dow should attempt to trade above 12592 otherwise the index may see a drop towards 12563 for an attempt at support. Below this level the index could struggle into the close to catch some gains. If the mood changes from negative to positive the index may seek to take out 12625 level and reach for 12670 today. Into next week, it is important for the Dow to hold onto 12450 to ensure that positive momentum continues over the weeks to come.Gold prices have recouped losses at the start of this week and managed to get back above the $1600 level. Once the metal clears $16880 we could see gold reach for $1730 - $1780 into next week\u2019s trading session.\nLog in and trade\nFrom time to time, City Index Limited\u2019s (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d) website may contain links to other sites and/or resources provided by third parties.\u00a0 These links and/or resources are provided for your information only and we have no control over the contents of those materials, and in no way endorse their content.\u00a0 Any analysis, opinion, commentary or research-based material on our website is for information and educational purposes only and is not, in any circumstances, intended to be an offer, recommendation or solicitation to buy or sell.\u00a0 You should always seek independent advice as to your suitability to speculate in any related markets and your ability to assume the associated risks, if you are at all unsure.\u00a0 No representation or warranty is made, express or implied, that the materials on our website are complete or accurate.\u00a0 We are not under any obligation to update any such material.\nAs such, we (and/or our associated companies) will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage incurred by you or any third party arising out of, or in connection with, any use of the information on our website and any such liability is hereby expressly disclaimed.\nSee Previous Market Commentaries\nAsian stocks were mixed following negative offshore leads (01/03/2012)Gold loses some lustre as US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke dismisses QE3\u00a0(29/02/2012)Investors on LTRO watch keeps the markets choppy (29/02/2012)\u00a0Better than expected numbers from Japan and Korea push Asian stocks higher\u00a0(29/02/2012)Asian stocks look set for more modest gains as US markets close higher (28/02/2012)Stocks gain as ECB's LTRO watched (28/02/2012)\u00a0Mostly flat trading day in Asia; Aussie dollar holds onto gains (28/02/2012)\u00a0Flat finish in the US may temper Asian markets today (27/02/2012)\u00a0Ask markets swing between gains and losses as material stocks weigh on index (27/02/2012)\u00a0FTSE closes flat on the day, underperforming broader EU stock charge (24/02/2012)\u00a0UK Q4 GDP unrevised at -0.2%.

{"id": "clueweb12-0503wb-00-27980", "bracket": "1.0", "text": "The Passion of the Mel \u2014 Capn Design\nCapn Design\nAbout\nFeed\nArchives\nThe Passion of the Mel\nThe Passion of the Christ opens today in theaters across America.\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, the film is opening on just over 3,000 screens.\nRelatively, Lord of the Rings opened on 3,700, Lost in Translation maxed out at 800 or so, and In America maxed out around 400 after opening on just 11 screens.\nEven more interesting is that Box Office Mojo is predicting a first weekend gross of $81.9 million.\nThat is crazy.\nMetacritic is giving it a score of 50 and Rotten Tomatoes is rating it at 54%, which is officially a stinker.\nOne of my favorite critics, AO Scott, panned it whie Roger Ebert loved it.\nI am presenting you with all this information because this movie is an anomoly.\nIt is a religious movie that is making it big due to its hype, which includes the strangeness of having an action star directing a movie about the death of Christ and accusations of anti-Semitism.\nPersonally, I don't plan on seeing it in the theaters.\nFrom what I've heard, the film is anti-Semetic on some level and I don't want to contribute to that.\nAs people I know start to see it, I may change my mind, but for the moment I don't want to give money to a project that is potentially racist.\nDespite my personal views, I am intrigued by the film's potentially huge first-weekend gross.\nOn the one hand it is frustrating that a religious movie, which I wouldn't expect to have mass appeal, is expected to do so well and open so wide when movies that I think are amazing get overlooked.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it sounds like this movie is riding on its hype.\nThink about it logically -- do you think that a highly controversial religious film that is mostly in Latin and Aramaic would do well in the theaters if done by a no-name director?\nOf course not, but that discussion will be saved for a future post.\nI shall leave you with a final thought on the violence in this film, from my home-town critic, Roger Ebert.\nNote: I said the film is the most violent I have ever seen. It will probably be the most violent you have ever seen. This is not a criticism but an observation; the film is unsuitable for younger viewers, but works powerfully for those who can endure it. The MPAA's R rating is definitive proof that the organization either will never give the NC-17 rating for violence alone, or was intimidated by the subject matter. If it had been anyone other than Jesus up on that cross, I have a feeling that NC-17 would have been automatic.\nPosted at 12:10 PM\n\u2190 Older\nNewer \u2192\nComments\ntjk\n02/25/04\n4:51 PM\nThe NYT had a great review of the film, basically saying that the problem with the film is not its bigotry (\"this on-screen villainy does not seem to exceed what can be found in the source material\") but rather the excessive violence:\n\"a film made with evident and abundant religious conviction that is at the same time so utterly lacking in grace.\"\nNot sure as of yet if i want to wait for this one to go to DVD.\nyour lady\n02/25/04\n9:19 PM\nHaving taken pictures for Newsday today of priests and rabbis post-viewing of this movie, interviewed the masses piling out of the theaters, and visited your link to Box Office Mojo, it seems utterly clear that people are going to either absolutely love or absolutely hate this film.\nThe priests called it amazing; the rabbis called it abominable and anti-semetic.\nOne Harvard-educated woman said it was a \"dangerous\" film, while a born-again christian said she was seeing it again on Saturday and taking her mother.\nAs a Jew, i am sure there is no way i would appreciate this film - I guess we'll be watching the DVD together, Matty. :)\nAbout this Entry\nThe entry \u2018The Passion of the Mel\u2019 has 2 comments.

The decision, if upheld, means that the team owes $3.6 million in back taxes for 2010 and 2011, plus similar amounts going forward.\nWithout getting too deep into tax law, public land usually goes untaxed \u2014 but it can be taxed, or can be subject to payments in lieu of taxes, if it's used for a strictly private purpose. Given that all the money collected at Red Bull Arena flows to the Red Bulls, the judge ruled that the \"public\" nature of the land was an accounting fiction, and demanded that the team cough up.\nWhether cash-strapped Harrison will see any money from this anytime soon is uncertain \u2014 the Red Bulls have promised to appeal, which could drag this out for years. (They're also still stiffing the city on $150,000 a year in rent.) But at least there's a chance of the city getting something back for its $80 million in land and infrastructure and $173 million new train station, aside from a bunch of muddy lots set aside for theoretical future development. (According to Business Week, payments from developers are running at just over one-tenth what was projected when the arena project was first planned.)\nGiven the number of teams that use the public-land, private-use dodge to avoid a stadium tax bill \u2014 which is to say, pretty much all of them \u2014 it's going to be interesting to see if this ruling sets any kind of precedent. Given that tax law varies widely from state to state, and who knows if this will hold up under appeal anyway, probably not, but it's an interesting idea for local governments to try to recoup some of the money they blew on stadiums in the hopes of sparking development that never arrived.\nPosted by Neil deMause in New York Red Bulls\nCOMMENTS\nThe Red Bulls are welcome in Harrison.\nThey can pay taxes like the rest of us overtaxed property owners.\nThe services the town provides in handling road traffic and what we have given up in convenient parking near the PATH station, not to mention the huge property tax increases we face for debt servicing are horrific.\nThis town is organized enough, and angry enough to make the Red Bulls pay up or move out completely.\nIf they would like to stall by appealing the decision, let's counter by forcing the stadium to go dark and let them sue us for eviction for failure to pay rent. Not paying contractual or court ordered settlements can work both ways.\nI would sincerely advise them to come to some amicable terms very, very quickly: the Mayor should propose to EITHER enforce the entire tax or enforce a more equitable rent: say $320k per month (to pay for services) and give the team 30 days max to consider the deal.\nThe next Mayor of Harrison will have a 100% mandate to start blocking all access to the stadium unless a deal is reached, and that's for starters.\nAny retained attorney that advises the team otherwise is merely padding their own fees: they shall not win anything for their client.\nI'd rather vote for town bankruptcy and merger with Newark or Hudson County with cancellation of all civic services than let the Red BullS--t get away with leveraging against blue collar local home owners.\nSincere advice to Trenton and beyond: this has the potential to flare into a much bigger, much nastier, front page kind of embarrassment.\nSuggest that the phone calls start going out to counsel in this case: the patience of the citizens has expired.\nPosted by Peter Talbot on January 20, 2012 10:35 AM\nNice to see the tax courts actually demonstrate a backbone on this issue.\nPosted by Joshua Northey on January 20, 2012 10:42 AM\nYeah, really sounds like they're \"welcome\" there.

Anyone know if there were other events there?\nPosted by JB on January 20, 2012 06:15 PM\nJB;\nMatters relating to assessment are complex, particularly as applied to commercial and 'non-linear' properties.\nI deal with assessment appeals (though not in New Jersey) and thus have some general background in this area.\nEvery jurisdiction has it's own rules and regs as relates to assessment and taxation, and I make no pretense toward knowing what these are in the state of NJ.\nIn general terms, commercial buildings and non linear property (things like trains, utility distribution systems etc) are not assessed based on their replacement or \"willing buyer/willing seller\" fair market value (as private homes generally are).\nThe reason for this is pretty obvious, given that these types of properties tend to sell infrequently and when they do the price rarely reflects the cost to build or rebuild the same asset.\nIn general, commercial property is valued based on it's highest and best use (which isn't always what the land is currently used for... for example, if you had an old barn on 10 acres of land in mid town Manhattan, you wouldn't be paying taxes based on the value of the farmland, but on what it would sell for if it was presently on the market and zoned for a use consistent with it's surroundings).\nSome types of commercial property are valued based on annual income (or potential).\nThis is a common method for rental and hotel properties.\nWe would need to know what method(s) the assessor used to arrive at an accurate explanation for the value given for this particular land and building, but I would assume RBA has been assessed based on it's income potential.\nAlthough it may seem counter-intuitive, it is not uncommon for multimillion dollar sports facilities (or other types of buildings) to be assessed at 10-20% of their construction cost - even when they seem practically new.\nThis is a reflection of the income generating ability of the building itself as a standalone asset (whether or not such a building is a good investment when it is assessed at 15% of it's cost one year after opening is another matter entirely...)\nIn the rare instances where these facilities are sold (generally by the municipality that built and owns them), they often sell for a value not far from the \"10-20%\" value mentioned above - sometimes much less (see Skydome).\nAs I understand the lease/ownership arrangement at RBA, the club paid for the building (more or less) and are the owners of same.\nThus, they are subject to any tax burden deemed payable by the state (assuming the present judgment isn't reversed on appeal) regardless of what other tenants might be present or events may be held.\nThis amount could be reduced if, for example, the stadium owners have agreed to payments in lieu of taxes (Pilots) to cover things like infrastructure connections, policing and the like.\nAs far as I know, they haven't done so, but I am not fully familiar with RBA or any agreements made with the city/state.\nHope that helps...\nPosted by John Bladen on January 22, 2012 03:42 PM\nThat is great info, John Bladen. Thank you.\nPosted by Ben Miller on January 23, 2012 10:08 AM\nYou're welcome, Ben.\nQuite often the answer to good questions like the one JB asked can lead to even more confusion!\nPosted by John Bladen on January 23, 2012 12:55 PM\nVery useful thank you. It does open a bunch of other questions but it could be never ending so I will stop there for now and do some research of my own. :-) (you provided plenty of direction for me). Thanks again.\nPosted by JB on January 23, 2012 04:32 PM\nJohn,\nIt's interesting to note that sports facilities depreciate like cars do. Glitzy and fun when new but hardly someone should view as a solid investment to own.\nIn Santa Clara the mayor is trying to refer to it as a \"municipal\" stadium. The 49ers will be paying no property tax.

But over time, the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989 have become convoluted and unwieldy to understand as successive amendments were made and changes emanating from Europe impacted on our domestic law.\nSo the Companies Act 2006 is a consolidating piece of legislation which will codify and re-arrange existing regulation into a more readily understandable and comprehensive source of law whilst giving effect to new aspects of regulation as part of the government's reform agenda.\nIn broad terms, the Act is designed to promote shareholder engagement and a long-term investment culture as well as introduce new provisions for small companies, for example, making it easier to set up and run a company. But it also introduces new requirements around narrative and performance reporting for all but the smallest of companies 1 \u2013 the subject of this review.\nHelpfully, in addition to codifying the requirements of the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive the Act ends much of the uncertainty following the withdrawal of the \u2018Operating and Financial Review' (OFR) which was abruptly abandoned by the government in November 2005. After the demise of the OFR, the government has re-affirmed its commitment to \u201cencouraging meaningful strategic, forward-looking information to assist shareholder engagement\u201d, but there are some notable differences between the narrative reporting provisions of the Act and the OFR it replaces.\nFor instance, although auditors will continue to be required to report on the consistency of the Directors' Report with the annual accounts (as is required by the Accounts Modernisation Directive) there will not be any additional requirement to check for other inconsistencies. Furthermore, all companies will be exempted from disclosing in the Business Review information which is seriously prejudicial to the company's interests. This exemption was previously only provided for companies that had to produce an OFR; and finally, there will be no statutory reporting standards for the Business Review. The former Accounting Standards Board (ASB) Standard (RS1) has been relegated to the status of a statement of best practice. So, for example, the Act is much less prescriptive than RS1 about the information to be disclosed when reporting KPIs.\nOne important change that may have gone unnoticed by many is that the requirements for narrative reporting have been streamlined so that the obligations for quoted companies are now more closely aligned to those for unquoted companies. The effect is that all companies (other than small companies) and not just quoted companies, will need to produce a Business Review as required by the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive, with the primary purpose of helping shareholders to assess how the directors have performed their duty to \u201cpromote the success of the company\u201d.\nThis white paper reviews the main provisions of the Business Review and explains the implications for performance systems and processes.\nNote 1 Companies normally fall into a size category if they meet two out of the three criteria\nCategory\nTurnover(not more than)\nBalance sheet total (not more than)\nNumber of employees(not more than)\nSmall company\n\u00a35.6 million\n\u00a32.8 million\n50\nMedium company\n\u00a322.8 million\n\u00a311.4 million\n250\nTiming:\nThe Bill was introduced to the House of Lords on 1 November 2005 and brought forward to the House of Commons on 24 May 2006. The Bill completed the Commons Committee stage on 20 July 2006 and received the Royal Assent this Autumn.\nHowever, the requirement to produce a Business Review is a current legal obligation introduced into the Companies Act 1985 to implement the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive. So in practice, companies must continue to prepare and publish a directors' report containing a business review for all financial years beginning on or after 1 April 2005.\nTHE DETAIL OF THE BUSINESS REVIEW\nUnless a company is subject to the small companies' regime, the directors' report must contain a Business Review. The purpose of the Business Review is to inform the members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the company (section 173).\ns.423 Contents of Business review\nSection 423 says that the Business Review must contain\u2013\n(a) a fair review of the company's business, and\n(b) a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company\nIt is also required to be a balanced and comprehensive analysis of \u2013\n(a) the development and performance of the company's business during the financial year, and\n(b) the position of the company's business at the end of that year, consistent with the size and complexity of the business.\nIn the case of a quoted company the Business Review must, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company's business, include \u2013\n(a) the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance and position of the company's business; and\n(b) information about \u2013\n(i) environmental matters (including the impact of the company's business on the environment),\n(ii) the company's employees, and\n(iii) social and community issues,\nincluding information about any policies of the company in relation to those matters and the effectiveness of those policies.\nIf the review does not contain information of each kind mentioned in paragraph (b)(i), (ii) and (iii), it must state which of those kinds of information it does not contain.\nIn addition, the review must, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company's business, include \u2013\n(a) analysis using financial key performance indicators, and\n(b) where appropriate, analysis using other key performance indicators, including information relating to environmental matters and employee matters.\n[\u201cKey performance indicators\u201d means factors by reference to which the development, performance or position of the company's business can be measured effectively.]\nWhere a company qualifies as small or medium-sized it does not have to produce key performance indicators in so far as they relate to non- financial information. (The precise rules governing what qualifies as a medium sized company are contained in s474 but in general, a company is medium sized if it meets two of the following three criteria; turnover not more than \u00a322.8m, balance sheet total not more than \u00a311.4m and number of employees not more than 250).\nA significant change is that the Act gives directors a safe harbour from civil liability in respect of statements or omissions made in the Business Review. Liability will only attach to directors if such statements are untrue or misleading and are made in bad faith or recklessly or, in the case of an omission, there is dishonest concealment of material facts.\nTHE CHALLENGES OF THE EBR\nSo the Business Review, sometimes referred to as the Enhanced Business Review or EBR deals principally with mid-sized companies, large companies and listed entities registered in the UK . However it is worth noting that countries right across the European Community will be seeking to embody the requirements of the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive in similar domestic legislation.\nAt first sight, the requirements of the EBR seem fairly innocuous and undemanding. Afterall, most companies should be able to produce a fair review of the company's business, and its trading position at the end of that year. However, there are a number of matters of emphasis and disclosure that need to be considered carefully and could present significant systems and process challenges for companies that are ill-prepared.\nBy and large, quoted companies should be in better shape to comply with the new legislation because the now defunct OFR acted as a \u2018dry run'. Although the last minute withdrawal of the OFR was frustrating for some, its likely implementation forced listed companies to launch OFR projects to plan for appropriate systems and processes to be put in place. But an unfortunate side effect of the sudden demise of the OFR is that the ensuing debate masked the fact that all companies were going to have to produce a Business Review and as such, many non-listed companies are poorly prepared.\nLeading up to the new millennium, many organisations lavished spending on ERP and other transaction systems rather than management information systems which have a pivotal role to play in support of narrative reporting. As a result, management information processes and enabling technologies are fractured and information of the sort envisaged by the EBR is not uniformly easy to gather. Over reliance on spreadsheets, coupled with separate processes and systems, including but not limited to, statutory and management reporting, strategy setting, budgeting, forecasting and performance measurement means that data is duplicated and scattered widely throughout most organisations. As a result many companies will find aspects of the Act more challenging than perhaps legislators anticipated.\nAn unhelpful aspect of the EBR is that commentators, the press and government refer to it as \u2018narrative reporting', which implies that it is a vague essay about performance. But as is so often the case, the devil is in the detail and close inspection of the Act's requirement's reveal that the areas covered are far reaching and extend into novel and unfamiliar territory such as environmental KPIs and forward looking statements.\nFurthermore, directors need to be mindful that there are penalties for reckless statements and although there are \u2018safe harbour' provisions, it is important that the EBR is grounded in reliable and robust systems and processes so that directors can fulfil their obligations to report and, just as importantly, demonstrate that they have acted in good faith.\nThe main challenges for companies in relation to performance systems and processes lie in the;\n\u2022 need to satisfy the strategic purpose of the EBR\n\u2022 obligation to produce a \u201cbalanced and comprehensive\u201d commentary\n\u2022 requirement to make forward looking statements\n\u2022 possible requirement to disclose KPIs, especially non-financial KPIs\nThe strategic purpose of the EBR\nThe main thrust of the EBR is to allow the \u2018members' of the company to assess whether the directors have been successful in their legal duty to \u201cpromote the success of the company\u201d \u2013 in essence, whether the company has satisfactorily carried out its strategy. \u201cSuccess\u201d is very broadly defined and, amongst other matters, the directors must have regard for the interests of the company's employees and the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment.\nThe EBR must be \u201cbalanced and comprehensive\u201d\nA balanced and comprehensive review suggests that underlying management information systems and processes should be capable of drawing together a wide range of information, gathered from multiple sources and that performance monitoring, measurement and reporting should capture good and bad performance i.e. balanced, throughout the reporting period, which now extends into the future (see below).\nForward looking statements\nThe need for forward looking statements about likely performance in the future based on an analysis of \u201ctrends and factors\u201d is a significant departure from existing company law which merely requires a review of historic performance. It will certainly require investment in appropriate planning, budgeting and forecasting systems.\nDisclosure of KPIs\nMost companies should have little difficulty preparing financial KPIs though management will need to judge which KPIs to disclose and ensure that they are consistently measured across the enterprise, since an EBR has to be produced for every company (apart from small companies) in the group. However, the requirement to produce non- financial KPIs, such as environmental or employee KPIs could be more stretching because of the need to decide the appropriate measures and draw on wider sources of information.\nTHE IMPACT ON APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSESS\nTaking these matters together, it can be seen that the EBR draws on a very wide set of interrelated business applications and processes. Collectively, these related processes are referred to as \u201cBusiness Performance Management\u201d (BPM). BPM is a \u2018closed loop' process that commences with the preparation of a business strategy, the development of budgets and operational plans and then provides the means by which actual performance against plan can be measured, monitored and reported. In the fullness of time, the experience and insights gained from an analysis of performance and an understanding of the key trends and factors affecting it can be used to refine the strategy before the cycle starts all over again \u2013 the closed loop.\nA typical performance management process\nWhilst the theory of BPM is well articulated in many organisations, there are often significant barriers to its implementation, such as an over-dependency on spreadsheets, the lack of suitable applications, enabling technologies and processes that bind them together.\nStrategy setting\nPerhaps the most under-served part of the BPM process is in the area of strategy setting and development. Given the pivotal role of strategy development for the conduct of the whole performance management cycle it is perhaps surprising that it is such a neglected process in so many organisations. Yet, it is often characterised by an un-auditable collection of standalone spreadsheets and documents which are not conducive to a strategically aligned organisation. The absence of suitable systems and process support in this vital area poses significant business risk to boards of directors seeking to demonstrate that they have \u201cpromoted the success of the company\u201d.\nClearly, it is management's responsibility to develop a practical and realistic strategy for the organisation. However, technology has a vital role to play in ensuring that, the strategy is communicated throughout the organisation, that operational plans and performance measures are strategically aligned with it and that monitoring systems highlight management actions that need to be taken to keep the strategy on course.\nTherefore, in fulfilling the obligations of the EBR, there is a strong requirement for software tools which support the iterative process of strategy development and allow the outcome to be documented and revisited as appropriate.\nPlanning, budgeting and forecasting\nOnce developed, it is crucial that performance objectives are built into the operational plans and forecasts of the organisation. The forward looking orientation of the EBR makes it essential that boards consider the effect of current trends and factors on performance in the future. In order to meet this objective organisations require a budgeting and forecasting application that allows for frequent re-forecasting and can improve the analysis and business insights that can be obtained from the process.\nModern web based planning applications encourage collaboration between budget holders, accelerate the re-forecasting process and through higher levels of participation can improve data quality and the frequency of re-forecasting. This latter point is important as the EBR requires directors to report in a \u201cbalanced and comprehensive\u201d way throughout the period. The more frequently that organisations can re-forecast, the more likely it is that directors are acquainted with the trends and factors affecting performance.\nScorecarding and dash-boarding\nHowever, if directors are to deliver success, it is vital that the strategy is communicated and understood throughout the organisation and that operational objectives and performance measures, which guide organisational behaviour, are strategically aligned.\nThis is where scorecarding and dash-boarding applications come into play. They are designed to help companies articulate their strategy using KPIs, communicate strategy across the enterprise and link it to operational objectives and initiatives. Leveraging this technology, individual and departmental goals can be aligned with corporate goals and objectives thus ensuring accountability for delivering results throughout the organisation.\nConsolidation\nThe EBR requires all of the strands of performance management to be brought together in a way that permits \u201cbalanced and comprehensive\u201d reporting across the enterprise for all periods under review. In this context consolidation applications used for management and statutory reporting form a very necessary part of the drive to capture information reliably from a variety of underlying data sources at the end of each accounting period.\nGiven the broadly based requirements of the EBR and in particular the possible need to report more widely on non-financial matters and related KPIs, consolidation systems become even more central to the solution. The ability to easily adapt data entry forms, collect statistical or memorandum information directly from the underlying transactions systems (ERP) and develop business logic as appropriate are essential to responding to the detail of the EBR.\nWeb based data entry bolstered by vendor certified adapters that allow integration with third party transaction systems are becoming essential features for modern performance management systems. They can significantly reduce reporting cycles leaving management with more time to analyse performance and take remedial action as necessary.\nReporting\nIn recent years the advent of cost effective, web deployable reporting has opened up performance management applications to a much larger population of end users. Increasingly, this extended population has grown to include individuals from all levels of an organisation and most functional areas. Indeed, the EBR, with its diverse reporting requirements, underlines the need to engage with more individuals from across different functional areas in the organisation. With environmental, employee and social reporting firmly on the agenda, it is important that, say, finance directors, HR directors, Production directors and Investor Relations professionals are bound into a joined up process and equally comfortable with reporting from the performance management system regardless of their skills and background.\nSo it is crucial too, that a performance management environment permits a variety of analytical tools to be deployed allowing users from different functional areas to select tools for the creation of regular production reporting, ad-hoc and interactive reports according to their personal preferences. As such, in addition to \u2018normal' reporting, a performance management platform should ideally provide choices around, dashboards, scorecards, dynamic spreadsheets and portals as well as making use of the latest techniques in alerting, customisable displays (colour coded meters, gauges and dials), animated pin-boards and \u201ctraffic lighting\u201d to highlight under or over performance in a visually striking way.\nINTEGRATION IS KEY\nThe performance management cycle as a business process draws on numerous specialised applications and potentially hundreds of underlying data sources to provide management insights. Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) tools, designed for bulk data transfers with no specific applications in mind are likely to prove lacking in a more challenging performance management environment. Newly emerging FDQM (Financial Data Quality Management) solutions created for complex performance management applications where interfaces are intricate and precision is vital will be more suitable. Specially designed to leverage the skills of the finance community to maintain financially oriented interfaces, they provide a bridge between source and target applications in a similar way to ETL but crucially provide visibility into the processes on either side, with full traceability of transactions backwards or forwards through the interfaces.\nOnce the data is captured from the source systems it is vital that performance management processes, applications and data are fully integrated so that the integrity of data is assured right across the performance management environment and that all users share the same information.\nIt is metadata that defines structural information, such as organisational hierarchies, account codes, time periods and product group dimensions that form the backbone of most performance management applications. Differences in metadata prevent reporting across applications and whilst it can be temporarily forced into alignment with clever mapping tools and technology it quickly slips out of alignment as changes are made to different business areas and applications. In theses circumstances, MDM (Master Data Management) style solutions that allows master data and data definitions to be staged in one repository so that the interrelationships between applications are defined and their metadata is synchronised throughout the performance management suite are crucial. MDM solutions ensure that amendments made to data structures by end users in any application are automatically reflected elsewhere so that any of the other applications working off the same data platform are automatically made \u2018aware' of the change. Using this technique, structures are brought automatically into alignment, reporting maintains its integrity and consistency of reporting is assured.\nUnfortunately, many organisations have grown their performance applications and processes in isolation, often using different software vendor's tools and spreadsheets which accentuate the differences. In these circumstances, each application is governed by its own business rules and data structures rendering comparisons of data held in different application areas unworkable. Making sense of all of this data presents significant management and IT challenges, particularly as the reporting landscape is constantly changing in the face of new reporting requirements. In addition a possible lack of consistency in reporting seriously jeopardises the reliability of reporting. In the context of the EBR, independent auditors have to attest that the claims made in the Business Review are consistent with the financial statements. Therefore, both management and auditors need certainty that, for example, a financial KPI reported in the EBR, such as Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is completely consistent with the same values derived from a scorecard, the monthly board pack and the current forecast.\nSo integration is at the heart of performance reporting and compliance with the EBR. It is only through integrated applications that management can be sure that the information it is using to analyse trends and factors affecting current and future performance is reliable and comparable over time.\nSUMMARY\nThe narrative reporting requirements of the Companies Act 2006 are part of a growing trend in company reporting towards the convergence of external and internal management reporting combined with a surge of interest in non-financial reporting, most notably; factors that affect employees, the environment and wider community. In effect, most of the provisions of the obsolete OFR have been re-introduced in the Act and apply equally to quoted and unquoted companies.\nThe breadth of disclosure requirements coupled with formidable obligation to make forward looking statements means that management has to have its \u2018finger on the pulse' of the company continually, analysing any trends and factors affecting performance right across the enterprise. Such demands mean that it is no longer viable for businesses to manage performance in functional silos or to use a series of unconnected applications and processes from different vendors which jeopardise data integrity. The need for constant appraisal of performance coupled the speed of reporting leaves no choice but for companies to standardise on an integrated performance management platform that can support robust and dependable processes from strategy setting right through to performance monitoring, analysis and reporting.\nBut the needs of narrative reporting in the Business Review now extend beyond the pure technical requirement to unify metadata, applications and technology. Potentially, the construction of a comprehensive and balanced EBR requires the involvement of different functional specialists from across the organisation which means that systems have to address a wide range of competencies. The winners in performance management will be those BPM vendors that can provide an adaptable and rewarding \u2018user experience' as well as an outstanding technical solution.\nAbout FSN Publishing Limited\nFSN Publishing Limited is an independent research, news and publishing Organisation catering for the needs of the finance function.

{"id": "clueweb12-0503wb-01-11548", "bracket": "1.0", "text": "Fixing America's Health Care Crisis\nFixing America's Health Care Crisis\nBy XAVIER MARTINEZ\nWashington, D.C.\nMost experts agree that the United States has set the standard for health\ncare innovation. Thousands of people from around the world travel to the\nUS each year for medical treatment not found anywhere else. But many analysts\nsay America's health care policy needs drastic reform.\nWill patients, doctors, insurance companies and the government see eye-to-eye\non health care reform?\nThe US government offers free health insurance coverage to some 27 percent\nof the population. For the elderly and many disabled Americans, the federal\nMedicare program covers about 80 percent of medical costs. Medicaid programs\nhelp insure the nations poor. And the State Children's Health Insurance Program\ncovers about six million low income children whose families are ineligible\nfor Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance. The rest of the\npopulation must find health care coverage on their own, typically through\nemployers.\nBut many Americans have to bear the full cost of health insurance. For an\naverage family, that ranges from 11 thousand to 12 thousand dollars a year.\nAnd even that does not cover the full cost of medical care. Millions of Americans\noften have trouble paying for prescription drugs and other treatments.\n\"Here is a country with a very expensive and very vast health care\nsystem that leaves many out of being able to participate fully in the abundance\nof the American health care system,\" says Diane Rowland, the Executive\nVice President of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit organization\nthat focuses on health policy in the United States. \"We need an America\nto reinvest in our people and reinvest in providing primary and preventive\nhealth care services equitably to all Americans.\"\nWhy Many are Uninsured\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, about 47 million\nAmericans do not have health insurance. Joel Cohen is Director of Social\nand Economic Research for the US government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. \"There\nare a lot of different reasons why people are uninsured -- some of which\nhave to do with what they perceive to be the affordability, some of which\nhave to do with their access to different kinds of health plans, and some\nof it has to do with their individual preferences as to how they view health\ninsurance and medical care.\"\nCohen says many people between the ages of 19 and 29\nbelieve they are healthy and do not need costly medical insurance. Overall,\nhe says, insurance coverage varies with the fluctuating economy. \"Most\npeople get their insurance through their employment. So as unemployment\nincreases, then people would have more difficulty getting insurance. On\nthe other hand, if the economy improves and more people are employed, then\nit would go down. So there is a little bit of an economic cycle to that.\"\nRadical Reform\nAbout 60 percent of Americans receive health insurance through their workplace.\nEmployers typically offer workers insurance plans that cover a portion of\nhealth care costs, leaving employees responsible for the difference. With\nnearly 16 percent of Americans uninsured, some analysts say federally-funded\nhealth care coverage for all Americans is the answer.\n\"We are the only industrialized country without universal health insurance\ncoverage,\" says Sara Collins, Assistant Vice President for the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that provides support for health care research. \"You\nnotice when you look at our rate of cost growth compared to France, compared\nto Germany, compared to Canada, we have a much higher rate of cost growth.\nWe spend a much larger percentage of our GDP [i.e., gross domestic product]\non health care costs than do other countries where everybody is in the same\nsystem. And we actually have much poorer health outcomes; we rank among the\nvery bottom in infant mortality compared to our neighbors overseas [in developed\ncountries]. I think that the health system would improve dramatically by\nincluding everybody in the system as other industrialized countries are doing\nnow.\"\nMany people equate universal health insurance with socialized medicine.\nBut analysts say socialized medicine is government control over all aspects\nof health care, while the government would administer only insurance programs\nunder a universal health insurance system. Critics of universal coverage\npoint out that patients in Canada and Britain, for example, often encounter\nlong waits for medical care and have little choice in selecting doctors.\nFixing the Current System\nScott Serota is President and CEO of the BlueCross BlueShield Association,\nthe largest group of private health insurance franchises in the US He admits\nthe current system needs reform, but he says he is wary of a system that\nmight not sustain America's standard of health care.\n\"My biggest comment to the critics of the current financing system\nis it has created a health care system second to none in the world. And we\nneed to ensure we continue to support that system while modifying the incentives\nin such a fashion that we can continue to afford that system,\" says\nSerota. \"I think we need to move away from a finger pointing exercise\nand toward a solution-oriented exercise, which says these are the problems\nand this is how we need to fix them.\"\nAccording to Serota, the insurance industry supports reforms that focus\non disease prevention, chronic illness management and health information\ntechnology. But, he says, the industry does not support reforms that would\nincrease government bureaucracy in order to manage the nation's health care\nindustry. Several public opinion polls show that rising health care costs\nare the number one domestic concern among US voters ahead of next year's\nnational elections.\nPolitical Positions\nDiane Rowland of the Kaiser Family Foundation says the\ntwo major political parties already are beginning to map out their positions. \"Among\nthe Democratic candidates, there's been a lot of discussion of how to improve\nhealth care services, how to improve the quality of care for everyone, how\nto try to bring down the inefficiencies in the system, so that we can have\nmore affordable health care services, and clearly providing for some way\nto help assist those who are lower income and need coverage. On the Republican\nside, we've seen much more of a commitment to some of the market-based strategies,\nincreasing the availability of tax credits for the purchase of health insurance\nand greater reliance actually on the individual market, on the private market,\nfor health care coverage where there's more consumer choice.\"\nPresidential candidates from both major parties agree that reform is needed.\nMeanwhile, most analysts predict that under the current system, the number\nof uninsured people in the US\n", "index": [[136, 149], [255, 257], [337, 344], [493, 495], [617, 626], [640, 648], [755, 796], [876, 884], [1039, 1048], [1252, 1261], [1487, 1495], [1573, 1597], [1662, 1675], [1689, 1696], [1810, 1819], [1862, 1878], [1897, 1906], [1963, 1969], [2000, 2002], [2016, 2058], [2922, 2931], [3151, 3160], [3236, 3245], [3399, 3416], [3552, 3558], [3572, 3579], [3593, 3599], [3685, 3688], [4436, 4442], [4447, 4454], [4723, 4725], [4827, 4834], [5748, 5750], [5840, 5864], [5963, 5973], [6328, 6338], [6822, 6824]], "wikipedia_ids": [3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 58353, 635422, 55794, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 4423394, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 57070, 3434750, 289862, 3434750, 1704517, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 875236, 5843419, 11867, 5042916, 12594, 5042916, 31717, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 4423394, 5043544, 32070, 3434750], "wikipedia_titles": ["United States", "United States", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Medicare (United States)", "Children's Health Insurance Program", "Medicaid", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Kaiser Family Foundation", "United States", "United States", "United States", "United States Census Bureau", "United States", "Social", "United States", "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Commonwealth Fund", "France", "Germany", "Canada", "Gross domestic product", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Kaiser Family Foundation", "Democratic Party (United States)", "Republican Party (United States)", "United States"]}

If your \"answer\" is an image or photo, this will be the title.\nFrom Wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\n-------------------------------\nOpen source describes practices in production and development that promote access to the end product's sources. Some consider it as a philosophy, and others consider it as a pragmatic methodology. Before open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of phrases to describe the concept; the term open source gained popularity with the rise of the Internet and its enabling of diverse production models, communication paths, and interactive communities. Subsequently, open source software became the most prominent face of open source.\nThe open source model can allow for the concurrent use of different agendas and approaches in production, in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial software companies.\n-------------------------------\nWhat is the absolute best that the open source model has to offer? The term is usually applied to software specifically, but I'd like to use it here to refer to any community developed project whose collaborative efforts are freely available to all to use and/or modify in any not-for-profit manner; This could include content, health, politics, religion, media, etc..\n5 years ago by\nholotone\n206 ANSWERS\n(1-15)\nTop All-Time\n30 days\n365 Days\nMore...\nSort Answers\nNewest \u00a0 \u00a0 |\nA to Z\nTime Travel What is this?\nThe chart failed to load.\nPlease make sure you have the latest version of the flash player.\nYou might also try clearing your browser cache.\nGet votes only from:\n-- Select --\nJun 06\nJul 06\nAug 06\nSep 06\nOct 06\nNov 06\nDec 06\nJan 07\nFeb 07\nMar 07\nApr 07\nMay 07\nJun 07\nJul 07\nAug 07\nSep 07\nOct 07\nNov 07\nDec 07\nJan 08\nFeb 08\nMar 08\nApr 08\nMay 08\nJun 08\nJul 08\nAug 08\nSep 08\nOct 08\nNov 08\nDec 08\nJan 09\nFeb 09\nMar 09\nApr 09\nMay 09\nJun 09\nJul 09\nAug 09\nSep 09\nOct 09\nNov 09\nDec 09\nJan 10\nFeb 10\nMar 10\nApr 10\nMay 10\nJun 10\nJul 10\nAug 10\nSep 10\nOct 10\nNov 10\nDec 10\nJan 11\nFeb 11\nMar 11\nApr 11\nMay 11\nJun 11\nJul 11\nAug 11\nSep 11\nOct 11\nNov 11\nDec 11\nJan 12\nFeb 12\nMar 12\nthru\n-- Select --\nJun 06\nJul 06\nAug 06\nSep 06\nOct 06\nNov 06\nDec 06\nJan 07\nFeb 07\nMar 07\nApr 07\nMay 07\nJun 07\nJul 07\nAug 07\nSep 07\nOct 07\nNov 07\nDec 07\nJan 08\nFeb 08\nMar 08\nApr 08\nMay 08\nJun 08\nJul 08\nAug 08\nSep 08\nOct 08\nNov 08\nDec 08\nJan 09\nFeb 09\nMar 09\nApr 09\nMay 09\nJun 09\nJul 09\nAug 09\nSep 09\nOct 09\nNov 09\nDec 09\nJan 10\nFeb 10\nMar 10\nApr 10\nMay 10\nJun 10\nJul 10\nAug 10\nSep 10\nOct 10\nNov 10\nDec 10\nJan 11\nFeb 11\nMar 11\nApr 11\nMay 11\nJun 11\nJul 11\nAug 11\nSep 11\nOct 11\nNov 11\nDec 11\nJan 12\nFeb 12\nMar 12\nPage: 1234567891011121314\u00a0 Next\u00a0\u203a\nRank Your Votes\nYour ballot is empty.

This morning I called to him, and he came over, very cautiously got onto the bed. Then started head-butting and rolling over and doing tummy fur and got under the covers and purred. Didn\u2019t stay there long. I\u2019ve been careful not to force him to do anything. I just call, and if he wants to come, he comes\u2026but he\u2019s getting more willing to pay attention. [Ysabel would come when I called, infallibly, dear old girl.] But no comparisons are fair. Sei came to us as a young gentleman, a year old, and he\u2019s got his own ways, which are very fine. Patience is my part in this transaction; trust, in his. So we have at least the beginning of a partnership. No, I\u2019m not fickle: I feel Ysabel\u2019s absence deeply, but I will do that for a long, long time. But Sei\u2019s at a crossroads, and I can\u2019t leave him there: I have to open the way for him to be him, and not ask him to be Ysabel, but to try to get those behaviors that are safety for a traveling kitteh, the willingness to be close to me, and to pay attention to my voice. He\u2019s caught in a moment of change, and wondering what happened and if there\u2019s now a room in the house that could be his, and he\u2019s interested; I have to meet that willingness fairly, and if I shed a tear or two in the process, well, kittehs don\u2019t understand that sort of thing half as well as they understand an offered lap and a cuddle.\nOctober 27th, 2011 |\nCategory: Journal\n12 comments to We\u2019re making progress\u2026\nphilbrown\nOctober 27, 2011 at 10:16 am\nLog in to Reply\nI see parallels between Sei and certain of your characters.\nPhil Brown\nhorsewisevt\nOctober 27, 2011 at 10:35 am\nLog in to Reply\nSei is the guide for the next part of your journey.\nA fire ceremony to honour Ysabel might be beneficial.\nHonour and release.\nShe will then be able to walk by your side from the energetic side of the fence, and that will then allow Sei to step into his role on this side.\nHe may need to know that the \u201cspace\u201d is open for him to step into.\nPart of that is awareness, that there has been and is going to be a significant transition on your journey, and inviting Sei to lead, guide and protect you.\nWOL\nOctober 27, 2011 at 1:55 pm\nLog in to Reply\nI think Ysabel waited until she was sure she was leaving you in good paws.\nEmpty Nest\nOctober 27, 2011 at 3:02 pm\nLog in to Reply\nI think horsewisevt has given an excellent suggestion.

Region 4, PAL. 1.78:1 (16:9 enhanced). Japanese DD 5.1, Japanese DD 2.0, English DD 5.1, English DD 2.0. English Subtitles. 105 minutes\nThe Movie\nCover Art\nCredits\nDirector:\nYoshihiro Nishimura\nStarring:\nEihi Shiina, Itsuji Itao, \tYukihide Benny, Shun Sugata, Keisuke Horibe\nScreenplay: Kengo Kaji, Sayako Nakoshi, Yoshihiro Nishimura\nCountry: Japan\nExternal Links\nYeah,\nso I confess \u2013 the only reason I was\ndrawn to Tokyo Gore\nPolice was because its title was Tokyo Gore Police. But I did know a bit about this flick before diving in blind; namely\nsome delightful accusations that it was the most ball-tearing Eastern\ngore flick since Riki-Oh, and that it starred Audition's\n\u00fcber-bitch Eihi Shiina battling it out with a katana against\nmutants. The deal, as they say, was sealed.\nTokyo\nGore Police posits a futuristic Tokyo where the mean streets are\ncommandeered by the \"Engineers\". The Engineers are the hideously\nmutated products of macabre human experiments in which people are\ninfected by a strain of DNA synthesised from that of various serial\nkillers, turning them into homicidal maniacs. The Engineers are also\nable to turn any injury they sustain into a lethal weapon, with some\ngenuinely repulsive results. The only thing that stops the Engineers\nentirely is the severing of the offending strand of DNA, a solid\nkey-shaped growth that may be removed upon autopsy. Little is known\nabout the Engineers and the only obstacle to their objective of\nunrelentingly terrorising the streets of Tokyo is the local police\nforce, a recently privatised behemoth that is absolutely ruthless in\nits approach to the mutants.\nThe\nstellar member of Tokyo's boys and girls in blue is Ruka (Shiina),\na pretty young thing who's pretty handy with a samurai sword. Ruka\nis haunted by the murder of her father, a Tokyo cop who was brutally\ngunned down in the streets, and she is set on finding his assassin in\namongst the various arse-kickery that comes with cleaning the streets\nof mutants that would make the X-Men wince. Her investigations lead\nher to the \"Key Man\", who is deeply involved with both her\nfather's murder and the Engineers.\nThe\ndirector of Tokyo Gore Police is Yoshihiro Nishimura, who\ngained tremendous cult acclaim with his special effects work on the\n2008 film The Machine Girl.\nThe roots of Tokyo Gore Police began with Media Blasters, the company that co-prodcued The\nMachine Girl, when they suggested Nishimura helm his own feature.\nNishimura opted to remake one of his short films, the 1995 flick Anatomia Extinction. Tak Sakaguchi, best known in cult circles\nfor his starring role in Ryuhei Kitamura's Versus, was\nbrought on as fight choreographer and Nishimura assembled a cult star\ncast, including Shiina.\nIf\nyou're expecting anything remotely coherent, Tokyo Gore Police isn't the movie for you; perhaps it's best thought of as the\nhell-spawn of Cronenberg and Miike, with a dollop of Lynch. Nishimura\nhas adopted for a \"low on brains, high on brawn\" approach, and by\nGod is it high on brawn \u2013 when the claret is spilled it rivals Braindead for sheer viscera and the comparisons to Riki-Oh are more than valid. Unfortunately, the absolutely threadbare\nplot is frequently lost in the pink mist (or rather deep-red showers;\nit's the House of Blue Leaves in colour, for 105 minutes) and a\nmajor fault is that it's just too long. About twenty minutes could\nhave easily been shorn off the running time to make Tokyo\nGore Police a very lean, mean little exercise in bloodshed.\nNishimura errs on the side of self-indulgence and just before the\nhyper-frenetic conclusion finally kicks in it's beginning to get a\nlittle tiresome.\nSomething\nshould be said here about the social commentary that is so central to Tokyo Gore Police and makes up a lot of its charm. Nishimura\nhas peppered fake advertisements throughout the film, some boasting\nthe sheer sadistic prowess of the police in their Darth Vader\nget-ups, others advertising razors that are easier to self-mutilate\nwith. While the parallels to Starship Troopers are clear,\nNishimura does a really good job with them for the most part \u2013\nthey're incredibly blackly funny and do the whole satirical bit\nquite well. The only input Nishimura had in these segments was\nsupervision and make-up effects. Instead, they were directed by\nNoboru \"The Machine Girl\" Iguchi and Y\u00fbdai Yamaguchi,\ndirector of the 2003 cult hit Battlefield Baseball. In one\ninterview, Nishimura said his main reasoning behind including the\nadvertisements was to lighten the tone of the picture and his desire\nto make some sort of social comment drawing upon his legal college\neducation.\nNishimura's\nown special effects mob Nishimura Motion Picture Model Makers Group\nis responsible for the special effects and for the most part they're\ndone really well. Some of these creatures are disgusting, nightmarish\nthings and that's a real testament to Nishimura's company's\ncreativity \u2013 particular kudos goes towards the crocodile mermaid\nand, to paraphrase the irate cop from The Doors, \"the guy\nwith the brain\".\nIn\namongst all of the madness, the incoherence, the blood and satire, Tokyo Gore Police is a pretty good film. Even though it\noutstays its welcome at 105 minutes, it's a quirky Japanese riff on\nCronenbergian body horror and the Eastern blood movie that's well\nworth your time.\nVideo\nPicture is presented in 1:85:1, with 16:9 enhancement. Although obviously shot on video, the image is very clear. No complaints here.\nAudio\nA fair smorgasbord of audio tracks are available depending on your technological capabilities or language preference \u2013 two Japanese Dolby tracks in 2.0 and 5.1 and two English Dolby tracks in 2.0 and 5.1. I'm dead-set against the inferior dubbed tracks so the Japanese 5.1 was the way to go for me and it sounded terrific.\nEnglish subtitles are also provided.\nExtra Features\nThis disc is light on extras \u2013 a theatrical trailer, extended promo trailer and stills gallery have been provided. However, the US Media Blasters disc is lighter still, including only a theatrical trailer. The local release is the way to go at the moment.\nThe Verdict\nA wildly entertaining film, even if it's just for the sheer spectacle of the thing. It gets a bit tired towards the middle and when exploring some very impossible connections between the Key Man and Ruka, but hey \u2013 it's grisly, ultra-violent Japanese mayhem at its delirious high point. Oh, did I mention there were mutants?\n3\nReader Comments\nShare:\nFat Boy Pete on 06/27/2009 @ 12:18\nComment # 3 of 3\nCrazy gore.

They have discussed how to solve the world's economic and environmental problems. Now they can do the right thing and remain to clean up the mess they have made. The city can levy fines on those responsible for the destruction of public property and for encouraging others to do so. It is common practice for the city to demand restitution in such cases.\nThose who supported Bellingham protesters can also donate to the city to offset the cost to the taxpayers to clean up the human and material waste dumped in our park.

Free speech is a right of every American; dumping your garbage in public is not.\nThe protesters can now claim a merit badge for civil disobedience. Play time is over; the Occupy Protesters should also demonstrate some respect to the citizens\nLETTER: Concerned about New York protesters\nLETTER: Concerned about New York protesters\nI am sure that I am not the only resident of Bellingham concerned by the recent displays of what I believe to be police brutality that occurred during the \"Occupy Wall Street\" protest in New York on Saturday, Sept. 24.\nDemonstrators protesting bank bailouts and the mortgage crisis were subjected to what I see as unwarranted aggression from members of the New York Police Department.\nLuckily, protesters were able to capture many incidences of this violence on video. But will these videos lead to an investigation into the conduct of New York's policeman? Currently, no investigation has been launched.\nProtesters block downtown Bellingham streets in 'Occupy Wall Street' rally\nProtesters block downtown Bellingham streets in 'Occupy Wall Street' rally\nBELLINGHAM - Parts of Cornwall Avenue were blocked as hundreds of protesters gathered downtown Friday afternoon, Oct. 7, to rally against economic inequality and corporations with too much power.\nThe rally was the first major local showing inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests that have been going since September in New York.\nProtesters gathered on all four corners of Cornwall Avenue and East Magnolia Street at 4 p.m. and marched to the Bank of America on Holly Street, chanting \"Banks got bailed out, we got sold out.\"\nLETTER:Says police avoided protest violence\nLETTER:Says police avoided protest violence\nIn Bellingham, the natural decency of the citizens and our well-trained police kept the recent \"Wall Street\" protest from erupting into violence.\nA counter-protester in a big truck with a God Bless America sign stopped for the red light at the Federal Building corner just as a large group of protesters arrived. When the light turned green, he revved the engine and zipped down toward Railroad Avenue, leaving a streak of black smoke drifting through the crowd.\nHe circled the block to halt again at the red light as the crowds passed on the sidewalks. A policeman took a position between the truck and the crowd but one young woman sat down directly in front of the truck. As the light turned green, the trucker attempted to turn away from the woman and pass her but it was too close and other protesters began to fill up the pavement.\nLETTER: Unhappy with 'Occupy' protests\nLETTER: Unhappy with 'Occupy' protests\nI believe the supporters of the Occupy Wall Street protests include the Democratic Party, Communist Party USA, American Nazi Party, SEIU, United Federation of Teachers, Transport Workers Union Local, Islamic groups, MoveOn.org, Michael Moore and all the left wing, government-knows-best crowd.\nSome are calling for all-out revolution.\nIn soviet Russia, Stalin used this type of mob mentality in gaining power and referred to them as \"useful idiots.\"\nOur constitution and free-enterprise system affords citizens, including these protesters, more freedom and opportunity than available anywhere else in the world.\nRecent Stories in this Section:\nLETTER: Shares surprising geography question\nLETTER: Decries lack of independent thought\nLETTER: Excited by advances in education technology\nLETTER: Disputes pollution of carbon dioxide\nWHATCOM VIEW: Community Bill of Rights seeks to shift balance of power\nLinks no longer allowed in story comments - Click here for troubleshooting commenting or how to report violations\nComments with web links or photos are not accepted to avoid linking to inappropriate sites.

In particular because Digital Book World took place, then O\u2019Reilly Tools of Change, plus the National Book Count data was released and our client Canadian Bookshelf announced today that Amazon.ca will be its lead sponsor for 2012 and they are rebranding as The 49th Shelf. Here\u2019s the big news in books.\nDigital Book World Conference\nDigital Book World keeps a running commentary on their blog of insights into publishing in the 21st century. Following the conference, attendees posted a number of summaries of the sessions and keynotes on various sites. Here are the standout factoids and anecdotes in my mind.\nPublisher optimism about the digital evolution has lessened over the past year. 72% of publishers feel they can be competitive in the new digital market (down 83% from last year).\nEbook sales increased 17% in 2011. For top publishers, 15% of their book sales were from digital in 2011. There is a lot of variation across publisher and dependent on the genre of books published.\nConsumer preference for reading ebooks shows 35% prefer dedicated e-readers (Kindle), 31% tablets (iPad), and 30% reading tablets (Fire, NookColor, Vox).\nAlso of note, Sourcebooks announced their experimentation with an agile publishing model.\nO\u2019Reilly Tools of Change Conference\nO'Reilly Media\u2019s Tools of Change conference returned to New York with a stellar line up of publishing innovators and technologists to talk about the present and future of publishing. This year\u2019s TOC kicked off with keynote presenter LeVar Burton. Burton heads a startup multimedia children\u2019s publishing venture called RRKidz that is based on his work hosting PBS\u2019s Reading Rainbow program. Watch the keynote and other presentations from the conference.\nTim Carmody, Wired Magazine, also presented on the Future of Reading, from Avant-Garde Poetry to Sportscenter.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpAXqHmRa0E\nNational Book Count\n25 books will have been sold or circulated in Canada by the time you read this sentence.\nThe above was Mark Medley\u2019s opening for his National Post article on the results of the National Reading Campaign\u2019s National Book Count. Read the full article: \u201cNational Book Count suggests Canada Reads\u201d\nIt\u2019s true. The numbers are in. Canada Reads. And based on our experience with client Canadian Bookshelf, there\u2019s a strong audience for Canadian-authored titles.\nCanadian Bookshelf Announces Amazon.ca As Lead Sponsor for 2012 and Rebrands as The 49th Shelf\nAnnounced today:\nCanadian books are getting a well-deserved boost today. Canadian Bookshelf announced Amazon.ca as its lead sponsor for 2012, and that the book community website will now offer expanded features and book listings under the new name The 49th Shelf. http://49thShelf.com\nRead the Full Press Release ...\nAs book fans and supporters of the Canadian publishing industry, I\u2019m looking forward to this next chapter with 49th Shelf.\nCheck out 49thShelf.com.

Vancouver, in particular, is playing a role in changing the Canadian publishing landscape with events like the Vancouver Book Club, the W2 Real Vancouver Writers\u2019 & Culture Series and BookCamp Vancouver.\nMonique, who the article states, \u201chas played an instrumental role in the digital growth of Canada\u2019s publishing industry\u201d was interviewed for the article:\nWhen Trottier started at Raincoast, she was one of only a handful of people in publishing who worked online.\n\u201cEven at that stage, it was clear that the hierarchy of conversation about books was collapsing,\u201d Trottier told the Straight at a Kitsilano coffee shop.\nPublishers\u2014and only publishers\u2014used to engage with media and booksellers, and then media and booksellers would communicate with retail buyers and the public. \u201cThe web has really collapsed that,\u201d Trottier said. \u201cThe conversation happens between readers and between writers, and then directly between readers and writers and publishers.\u201d\nWhile social media allow publishers to listen more closely to their markets, Trottier acknowledges that they\u2019re not the silver bullet that will save the industry. \u201cPublishers are going to save themselves when they figure out what their new business model is,\u201d she said.\nRead the full article.\nPosted by Crissy Campbell.\nFiled under:\n\u2022 Work\n\u2022 Publicity\n2 Comments\n|\nEmail this | Permalink\nMonday, October 11, 2010\nInteresting Vancouver 2010\nFriday, October 8 was Vancouver\u2019s 3rd Interesting event.\nInteresting was founded in London, UK by Russell Davies and now has chapters around the world.

Often, the only saving grace is some old or historical building that stands out because it is so different to the glass, steel and plastic facades of today. The venerable landmarks are usually officially \u2018listed\u2019 for preservation, whilst some simply escape the rush to modernisation.\nHowever, there\u2019s evidence that places which are retaining their historic environments are doing better economically. We\u2019re told there is something in the human psyche that makes people enjoy being in historic environments. Sounds like a no-brainer, though obviously not to many commercial developers who ran riot during the boom years.\nBut, just think for a moment of how a town such as Clonakilty, in west Cork, can make the most of its built heritage, or why Adare, Co Limerick, always seems packed with tourists and coaches. The prime reason surely is that both are lovely places in which to be, enhanced by a deep sense of tradition and atmosphere.\nThe east Cork town of Youghal, famous for its built and natural heritage, sees a heritage-led regeneration plan as compensating in some way for huge losses in local manufacturing in the past decade.\nYoughal Town Council has come up with a strategy that includes conservation of the landmark Clock Gate, work estimated to generate a \u20ac400,000 spin-off for local business each year. Property owners on the Main Street are also being offered a 50% grant to paint their facades in a historically-sensitive way. Conservation of the Youghal\u2019s town walls is also a key part of the plan.\nA recent Heritage Council conference on economic growth heard London-based property adviser David Geddes tell how historic environments in towns and cities play a critical role in nurturing types of business clusters that do not otherwise normally develop.\n\"It is important that those responsible for planning and regeneration in every town and city across Ireland have a good understanding of its historic environments in their town and city and a plan for making the most of them,\" he said.\nMr Geddes has conducted extensive research in Britain into the economic and social effects that historic environments have in towns and cities and has been working on the implications, in Ireland, for Limerick and Waterford.\nA survey of 35,000 people living across Britain found that cities known for their heritage dominated the top ratings, with York emerging as the most enticing English destination outside London, and Edinburgh twice as popular as Glasgow.\n\"There is a direct correlation between the number and nature of heritage assets in cities and towns and their appeal as places to live, work and visit,\" Mr Geddes noted. \"It is not just a case of people liking historic environments, they like the types of activity that takes place in those environments.\"\nThe research showed the importance of creating environments where people enjoy spending leisure time. Brighton is cited as an example.\n\"Making the most of historic environments is the only known way of overcoming the blandness of town centres that people so often complain about, the so-called \u2018clone town\u2019 effect where every town centre looks alike,\" Mr Geddes remarked.\nHeritage is even the key factor in the success of world famous streets like London\u2019s Bond Street and Regent Street, he stated. They attract top rents and shops that are not found elsewhere because modern retailing spaces have been created behind historic facades. That gives them an edge over nearby Oxford Street.\nMr Geddes said the lessons from Britain were totally applicable to towns and cities across Ireland. The long-term prosperity of Limerick city centre, for example, is entirely reliant on making more of its great historic assets.\n\"It should be aspiring over the medium to long-term to make O'Connell Street the finest in Ireland, to use the castle and riverside to create the best riverside park in Europe and to nurture concentrations of interesting small businesses in the historic areas on the edge of the city centre. It is lucky to have the assets to be able to do that. Now, it is a question of making the most of them.\"\nCommenting on David Geddes\u2019 research, Heritage Council\n", "index": [[666, 673], [1602, 1612], [1622, 1626], [1676, 1681], [1683, 1694], [1877, 1881], [1890, 1897], [2067, 2087], [2271, 2282], [2394, 2401], [2456, 2472], [2509, 2515], [2804, 2811], [2986, 2993], [3128, 3135], [3141, 3149], [3154, 3163], [3205, 3212], [3288, 3292], [3323, 3330], [3351, 3357], [3363, 3372], [3393, 3400], [3810, 3818], [4156, 4162], [4165, 4176], [4181, 4194], [4380, 4393], [4427, 4434], [4486, 4493], [4523, 4531], [4683, 4699], [4714, 4721], [4792, 4798], [5058, 5074]], "wikipedia_ids": [14560, 314824, 8140815, 1034846, 97827, 8140815, 354386, 354386, 23523337, 354386, 1779845, 17867, 14560, 31717, 14560, 97827, 2802645, 31717, 34361, 9316, 17867, 9602, 68736, 49796, 17867, 370048, 229189, 229195, 31717, 14560, 97827, 168758, 14560, 9239, 1779845], "wikipedia_titles": ["Republic of Ireland", "Clonakilty", "Cork (city)", "Adare", "County Limerick", "Cork (city)", "Youghal", "Youghal", "Main Street", "Youghal", "Heritage Council (Ireland)", "London", "Republic of Ireland", "United Kingdom", "Republic of Ireland", "County Limerick", "Waterford GAA", "United Kingdom", "York", "England", "London", "Edinburgh", "Glasgow", "Brighton", "London", "Bond Street station", "Regent Street", "Oxford Street", "United Kingdom", "Republic of Ireland", "County Limerick", "O'Connell Street", "Republic of Ireland", "Europe", "Heritage Council (Ireland)"]}

Jack goes down, there is no feature back left on the roster.\nDavis used to be, but no longer.\nFisher never was, never will be.\nI'm not fond of committees, but used properly these two together may move the ball better than expected\nFB - Hedgecock - With Smith out, this is where we stand now.\nThe kid is still young, and learning his 2nd NFL offense in as many years.\nBut once he's comfortable, this kid will be a wrecking ball.\nHe won't carry the ball, nor do we want him to.\nHe does one thing and does it well.....lead block.\nReceivers\nWR - Curtis & McDonald - It's just not fair in this case.\nBoth these guys are quality wideouts and would start on a lot of other teams.\nSo I have no problem with them as starting wideouts.\nThe problem I have is the dropoff from Holt/Bruce to Curtis/McDonald.\nC & D are more than servicable.....but when is the last time \"servicable\" ever passed muster when referring to a Rams wideout?\nTE - Walker - He was impressive in his limited time.\nI don't think he's the pass catching threat of Klop, but I love his blocking skills.\nHe would do a fine job, assuming Linehan adapts to the differences between Klop and Walker\nO-Line\nOT - Steussie/Strojny - Here's where it turns ugly.\nOther than Pace and Barron, there's only one other OT on the roster, Steussie.\nSo now we have to dip into the practice squad with Strojny.\nThe only thing that keeps me from sweating bullets on this one is because in this scenario Bulger is already hurt.\nThey can't hurt him twice.\nOG - Goldberg/Setterstom - This spot has already seen plenty of flux this year, but assuming day 1 starters (RI & AT) are out, I don't have a huge problem with Goldberg and Setterstrom.\nGoldberg is proving himself now, and I think Setterstrom is better than a typical 7th round rookie.\nWouldn't want to leave with them forever, but I like the OG position better than the OT position in this one.\nOC - Incognito - Again assuming day 1 starter (McCollum)....oh wait, no need to assume.\nThis one is reality and will be the rest of the year.\nPersonally, I'm all for it.\nI think RI is doing a great job adapting to the spot, and I'd like to see him stay there.\nD-Line\nDE - Adeyanju/Green - Vic is already getting his time and proving to be solid in the run game.\nHis pass rush hasn't shown itself yet, but maybe that's around the corner.\nGreen is green....high motor, all-effort...but nothing spectacular.\nDT - Fisk/Wroten - After preseason, I was very excited to see what Wroten was going to bring.\nApparently, the coaching staff has yet to share my thoughts.\nFor now, Wroten still has that \"potential\" albatross around his neck.\nAs for Fisk, solid veteran who is doing a decent job of sucking up linemen to open holes for blitzers.\nLinebackers\nSLB - Smith - I'm not going to lose much sleep over this one.\nChillar has not been everything I hoped for, and Smith could do just as well in my opinion.\nMLB - Brooks - The preseason phenom.\nCan he translate that to the regular season?\nI'm guessing no, but as with the WR spot, he's backing up today's icon, so Brooks won't get a fair shake if he has to take over.\nWLB - Coakley - From what we've seen so far, DC has returned to a younger form.\nHe's playing both the run and especially the pass pretty well, when he's in.\nIf he had to take over for Pisa, I'd certainly miss Pisa, but DC would be effective\nDefensive Backs\nCorner - Hill/Butler - Hill will still make rookie mistakes, but his time to start is right around the corner.\nButler on the other hand must not be right, either physically or mentally.\nCan Butler come back to form?\nIf so, I don't have a problem with him and Hill at the corners\nFS - Bartell - A huge question mark.\nI'm pretty certain Bartell will not be as comfortable as Atogwe is at this point, simply from lack of experience, but Bartell has all the physical and mental tools to be a decent centerfielder, at least comparable to Atogwe.\nSS - Carter - I can't get excited about Carter, especially following Chavous.\nThere's no doubting his work ethic or how much effort he displays, but his coverage skills make him look more and more like a small LB rather than an effective SS.\nHowever, he has more experience than most on this list, so who's to say?\nSo, would this team make it happen?\nProbably not, but then again I'm not convinced the 1st string will take us to the promised land either.\nI'd feel okay about our offense with the exception of OT, and that's a bad spot to be uncomfortable about when talking about moving the ball.\nOn the defense, the pass rush would be non-existent, so I'm afraid opposing QBs would pick us apart like fish in a barrel.\nTHIS WAS A TEST OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM.\nHAD THIS BEEN A REAL EMERGENCY YOU WOULD HAVE NOTIFIED OF WHICH NEAREST DOOR TO GO SLAM YOUR HEAD IN WHILE WAITING FOR THE SEASON TO END AND STARTERS TO GET HEALTHY.\nWE NOW RETURN YOU TO YOUR REGULARLLY SCHEDULED SEASON.\n\"Before the gates of excellence the high gods have placed sweat; long is the road thereto and rough and steep at first; but when the heights are reached, then there is ease, though grievously hard in the winning.\" --- Hesiod\nReply With Quote\n-10-06-2006\n#2\nRamOfDenmark\nRegistered User\nJoin Date Apr 2006\nLocation Denmark\nAge 28\nPosts 1,071\nRep Power\n19\nRe: The Nuclear Option\nIt's not all that bad, we actually have decent depth this year I think.

Read All About it Here\nSridhar Wins Top Indian Award\nIndia's leading male badminton player Anup Sridhar has been honoured with one of the country's highest sporting accolades.\nSridhar joined some of India's top sporting names in receiving an Arjuna Award at the Rashtrapi Bhawan venue in Delhi.\nHe was one of 11 Indian athletes who received an Arjuna Award, with the main Rajiv Gandhi Khen Ratna Award going to Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.\nSridhar was delighted to have been among such illustrious company in Indian sports, saying only that \"the best is yet to come\".\nIndia has produced world-class badminton players in the past, most notably former All England men's singles champions Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand.\nThe Bangalore-born 25-year-old is India's Thomas Cup captain and enjoyed one of his best years on the tour of the past year.\nHe ended 2007 as the highest ranked Indian at 25 in the world, rising to a career high of 24 in early 2008.\nIn terms of tournament play, he reached the semi-finals at the German Open as well as the Asian Championships and the quarter-finals of the Thailand Open.\nOne of his best performances came with his quarter-final appearance at the 2007 World Championships.\nThat was when he beat then Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat, of Indonesia, in an epic match that was one of the longest in the tournament. His victory was also rated among the top-10 Indian sporting performances of the year.\nHe launched his 2008 campaign in fine style by winning the prestigious Pramod Mahajan All-India ranking tournament in New Delhi. He continued his excellent form by reaching the last 16 of the Malaysia Super Series where he lost to South Korea's eventual champion Lee Hyun-il.\nSridhar also played at the Beijing Olympics last month. He beat Marco Vasconcelos of Portugal in the first round 21-16, 21-14 but was beaten in the round of 16 by Japan's Shoji Sato 21-13, 21-17.\nSridhar, though, isn't finished yet and there is still plenty of potential for him to show what he can do in the major championships.\nCertainly, he has two excellent models in Padukone and Gopichand\n", "index": [[260, 265], [298, 310], [383, 390], [406, 411], [449, 461], [495, 500], [519, 525], [551, 563], [618, 624], [641, 661], [663, 670], [732, 738], [791, 796], [873, 884], [909, 925], [930, 947], [953, 962], [983, 988], [991, 1001], [1110, 1116], [1245, 1256], [1322, 1335], [1412, 1436], [1465, 1472], [1482, 1496], [1501, 1510], [1620, 1626], [1733, 1747], [1780, 1789], [1854, 1875], [1893, 1904], [1925, 1936], [1938, 1945], [1965, 1981], [2002, 2019], [2023, 2031], [2101, 2106], [2134, 2141], [2323, 2332]], "wikipedia_ids": [14533, 9834947, 9834947, 14533, 442475, 51585, 14533, 442475, 14533, 1695229, 9834947, 14533, 14533, 3795922, 1220321, 1500470, 44275267, 14533, 1630582, 14533, 3953139, 12207976, 2484388, 22576, 906906, 14579, 14533, 4849596, 51585, 10145751, 27019, 906870, 9834947, 77745, 907266, 576328, 15573, 9834947, 1500470], "wikipedia_titles": ["India", "Anup Sridhar", "Anup Sridhar", "India", "Arjuna Award", "New Delhi", "India", "Arjuna Award", "India", "MS Dhoni", "Anup Sridhar", "India", "India", "All England Open Badminton Championships", "Prakash Padukone", "Pullela Gopichand", "Bangalore", "India", "Thomas Cup", "India", "German Open (badminton)", "Thailand Open (badminton)", "2007 BWF World Championships", "Olympic Games", "Taufik Hidayat", "Indonesia", "India", "Pramod Mahajan", "New Delhi", "Malaysia Open (badminton)", "South Korea", "Lee Hyun-il", "Anup Sridhar", "2008 Summer Olympics", "Marco Vasconcelos", "Portugal national football team", "Japan", "Anup Sridhar", "Pullela Gopichand"]}

Some nice tidbits!\nGrave_Addiction06-24-2005, 12:33 PMHopefully not a repost.\nhttp://www.optimalcamouflage.com/reggie_retail.wma\nevilmax1706-24-2005, 12:34 PMBullet point summary anyone?\nGrave_Addiction06-24-2005, 12:53 PMIt can be kind of hard to hear Reggie at times, so I typed up the entire clip as best I could.\nAs you can see, Revolution will more than hold its own in graphical performance.\nWhat we also know is that what you publishers and developers see when you look at the spec sheet of our competitor's new systems. Larger budgets, higher staffing, steeper learning curve and longer production schedules.\nNintendo Revolution is designed to be none of these. Our conscious decision was to take a different path. Revolution will be the home to stunning new game masterpieces from Nintendo and our third parties.\nIn fact, the balance built into Revolution makes it the perfect choice to achieve your highest creative goals. But if your budgets are a little more (motto?), I would recommend to also envision the creation of much better game experiences with much less hassle.\nWe expect the time frame needed to make Nintendo's Revolution game to be substantially shorter than all of our competitors. In effect, we see Revolution to be the best new console for game developing partners no matter what type of game you're making.\nFinally for all of our retail partners, I can hear you whispering under your breaths, \"Don't tell me about developing games, just tell me what games you're gonna deliver.\"\nWell, let's talk about that. First, we expect the great third-party support we now have on Gamecube to be both stronger and earlier on the Revolution. And we will be more aggressive than ever in having our own new in-house stars, the greatest gathering of (byte-sized characters?) in history by as early as possible.\nYou can expect new Nintendo intelluctual properties in the launch window. Our franchise stars are about to make some new friends.\nAnd you should know that development of new Revolution titles is already underway.\nJavery06-24-2005, 12:55 PMNice!\nevilmax1706-24-2005, 12:58 PMMuch much appreciated for that, thank you.\n\"our already great third party support\" was funny.\nSounds like they saw a video at first.\nShorter dev times + easy dev = hopefully tons of games\nStrell06-24-2005, 12:59 PMnew game *couldn't understand what he was saying here* from Nintendo and our third parties.\nHe said \"masterpieces.\"\nThat's all I have to add.\nNow, where did this come from?\nThis speech?\nI mean it sounds like we've only got about the last half of this speech.\nIt's apparent that at some point he must have been discussing raw graphical power.\n\"It will more than hold its own.\"\nThat makes feel a bit better about that issue, but it is Reggie, meaning I know it's his job to hype...He mentions competitor spec sheets as if he has something comparable to them right now (i.e., as he's talking to these people).\nThere's got to be some information on this somewhere.\nI need some serious reassurance about the graphics, and it sounds like this could be the first indication that the power issue is about to be put to rest.\nI mean, if all the systems are within 10% or so of each other in terms of raw power, then the graphics debate is dead.\nPut the best graphical games of all three systems now, and you can barely tell a true difference.\nI assume it's going to be exactly the same for the next generation.\nOf course, that's just all my speculation.\njkam06-24-2005, 01:02 PMSounds good. I want to see Kid Icarus back! I think Nintendo has a good idea with giving developers an easier task. It would be nice to see the Revolution get really solid 3rd party support. I wouldn't mind seeing some of the things that the XBOX and the PS2 got such as Street Fighter Anniversary Collection (online) as long as there done right. The N64 and the Cube had great games but lacked in pure numbers of titles. With this new approach they may be able to swing some back their way. Anxiously awaiting this console.\nryanbph06-24-2005, 01:03 PMI thought their was a recent interview with nintendo, saying they weren't done with the revolution.\nHow are they making the games, if they don't have an idea on what the revolution will be.\nI am sure it will be easy to develop for Nintendo, but doesn't the XNA, also cut down on costs and development time?\nevilmax1706-24-2005, 01:06 PMI need some serious reassurance about the graphics.\nIt's been said that the Rev will be 3 times more powerful than the GCN.\nLook at RE4, and picture it times 3.\nI think that would look pretty good!\nthe3rdkey06-24-2005, 01:07 PMI thought their was a recent interview with nintendo, saying they weren't done with the revolution.\nHow are they making the games, if they don't have an idea on what the revolution will be.\nI am sure it will be easy to develop for Nintendo, but doesn't the XNA, also cut down on costs and development time?\nThey are done with the SPECs,\nthe final system design will be smaller.\nStrell06-24-2005, 01:09 PMYea, and I know the bullshit \"OMG 1600 TIMES MORE POWERFUL\" from MS and Sony is just hype, and that the 2-3x power is something conservative from Nintendo, but I still want something a little more concrete than vague jargon.\nStill, even a leap of that beyond Zelda/RE4/Metroid Prime is enough to render my brain dizzy.\nJavery06-24-2005, 01:11 PMWell, we know games won't look as nice on the Revolution simply due to the lack of HD support unless you are one of those billion unlucky bastards without an HDTV...\nStrell06-24-2005, 01:14 PMLet's see.\n15 FPS game on HD.\nOr 60 FPS game on normal tv.\nYea, I'm worried too.\nwillardhaven06-24-2005, 01:22 PMa 20\" signal with s-video or component cables makes a lot of HD sets look like crap...\nscrew resolution, I like high FPS myself.\nRevolution sounds like it will be good, I wish we could just get Gamecube 2 though.\njkam06-24-2005, 01:25 PMWell, we know games won't look as nice on the Revolution simply due to the lack of HD support unless you are one of those billion unlucky bastards without an HDTV...\nI know your'e really ticked about the Revo and HD. There are already some sites up to try to sway Nintendo.\nhttp://www.1080up.org/\nYou may want to e-mail Nintendo yourself as well. The more people that do may sway them to add it.\nD4rkewolfe07-07-2005, 01:38 AMFirst -- please be civil and post here. Too many HD topics floating around.\nSecond -- HD is up in the air. Whether an article says it will be on there, or one says it won't, with over a year before release, anything can change.\nThird -- Would the addition or subtraction of HD have an effect on you buying a Revolution? Is it that important to you?\nFinally -- Have a conversation, not a fight\nThat's from one of the NOA people in their forums.\nSo with the list going around, if you really want it, have it signed.\nAs they said, anything can change.\nPawnTakesKing07-07-2005, 02:15 AM...unless you are one of those billion unlucky bastards without an HDTV...\n*raises hand in shame*\nMorPhiend07-16-2005, 07:35 PMHe said \"masterpieces.\" That's all I have to add.\nNow, where did this come from? This speech? I mean it sounds like we've only got about the last half of this speech. It's apparent that at some point he must have been discussing raw graphical power. \"It will more than hold its own.\" That makes feel a bit better about that issue, but it is Reggie, meaning I know it's his job to hype...He mentions competitor spec sheets as if he has something comparable to them right now (i.e., as he's talking to these people). There's got to be some information on this somewhere. I need some serious reassurance about the graphics, and it sounds like this could be the first indication that the power issue is about to be put to rest.\nI mean, if all the systems are within 10% or so of each other in terms of raw power, then the graphics debate is dead. Put the best graphical games of all three systems now, and you can barely tell a true difference. I assume it's going to be exactly the same for the next generation.\nOf course, that's just all my speculation.\nAs to the graphical power, all I can say is search for the thread back around e3 time about the new patent concerning cube mapping. Some said that was old technology. But read the whole patent. It is not the same as the old \"cube maps.\" It is a new technology that is designed to allow for \"low\" spec systems that consume low power to outperform high tech, expensive, loud energy wasting chipsets. I wouldn't be surprised if the specs themselves are on par with M$, and in practice are up to Sony's system - if this tech actually is part of the RevOlution...\nEDIT: I justlistened to this. Isn't it the pre-e3 Nintendo conference? Thatthing was an hour long. That's probably why you didn't notice.\nSarang0107-22-2005, 05:59 PMI know your'e really ticked about the Revo and HD. There are already some sites up to try to sway Nintendo.\nhttp://www.1080up.org/\nYou may want to e-mail Nintendo yourself as well. The more people that do may sway them to add it.\nI plan to call Nintendo out on it ON the radio and KC, hopefully to shame them into it.\nI'm a Nintendo fan and already have a HD set and will be severely PISSED if Nintendo doesn't support it.\nAlso I'm even willing to PAY extra to get a Revolution with an HDMI and new Firewire\n", "index": [[611, 621], [895, 914], [1132, 1142], [1413, 1423], [1504, 1514], [1877, 1885], [1925, 1935], [3786, 3796], [3903, 3913], [4001, 4005], [4014, 4017], [4110, 4113], [4122, 4126], [4568, 4571], [4723, 4726], [4766, 4769], [4779, 4782], [5131, 5134], [5204, 5209], [5343, 5345], [5350, 5354], [5669, 5679], [5706, 5708], [6122, 6130], [6211, 6221], [6248, 6250], [6378, 6380], [6865, 6867], [6899, 6909], [8844, 8848], [8897, 8907], [9124, 9126], [9358, 9360], [9563, 9567], [9576, 9584]], "wikipedia_ids": [421853, 421853, 421853, 421853, 421853, 53525, 421853, 16892, 421853, 17416342, 15822958, 21849, 53525, 550616, 99176, 53525, 1310512, 550616, 14171448, 19001, 26989, 421853, 16315657, 53525, 421853, 16315657, 16315657, 16315657, 421853, 26989, 25964, 16315657, 16883, 537442, 26246088], "wikipedia_titles": ["Wii", "Wii", "Wii", "Wii", "Wii", "GameCube", "Wii", "Kid Icarus", "Wii", "Xbox (console)", "PlayStation 2", "Nintendo 64", "GameCube", "Microsoft XNA", "The Reverend", "GameCube", "Resident Evil 4", "Microsoft XNA", "Specification (technical standard)", "Microsoft", "Sony", "Wii", "High-definition television", "GameCube", "Wii", "High-definition television", "High-definition television", "High-definition television", "Wii", "Sony", "Revolution", "High-definition television", "Kansas City Royals", "HDMI", "IEEE 1394"]}

After becoming lord lieutenant and governor-general of Ireland (1754), he succeeded to the dukedom (1755); and the following year he agreed to become nominal prime minister. William Pitt had refused to serve in the ministry of the Duke of Newcastle, and the great Whig families balked at Pitt himself becoming prime minister. Thus, Devonshire was summoned to the post, while Pitt became the ministry\u2019s real authority as secretary of state to manage the war. When Pitt reconciled with Newcastle the following year, Devonshire, without having made much of a mark on events, resigned and became lord chamberlain of the household, a post he held until 1762.\nLINKS\nRelated Articles\nAspects of the topic William Cavendish, 4th duke of Devonshire are discussed in the following places at Britannica.\nAssorted References\nhistory of United Kingdom \u00a0(in\u00a0 United Kingdom: Conflict abroad)\nCitations\nTo cite this page:\nMLAAPAHarvardChicago Manual of Style\nMLA Style:\n\"William Cavendish, 4th duke of Devonshire.\"\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

(however this was something for me, so I was also the director).\nI will not shoot without an AC, it is necessary to have one.\nI wonder if your question isn't broad enough though. besides the duties :\nPreproduction planning, scheduling, Choosing equipment ( on my level I tend to be the one writing the order for Grip/Electric, as well as Camera, I'm sure that there are many who DP's who work bigger budgeted/crewed jobs who discuss the job with their Keys, and let them take care of the specifics, such as how many C-stands and sand bags), color timing ( either TK, or Print {with a colorist}). I've gone on location scouts alone and ended up having to secure the location for production ( being grilled by a member of the Judiciary is not fun), and I won't do that again.\nIt seems to me, that the DP is also Management ( when looked at from a labor stand point). Although it is not always the case, certainly there are crossover aspects from each side. Besides asking what a DP's duties are, should we also ask over which \"things\" (for want of a better word) a DP has absolute control over, and cannot be overidden?\nIt is a tough question, I've gone from one shoot that was so badly organized by production that I had to do the Tie in, run the cable, and hang most of the lights ( as well as share AD duties with the Sound man and the KEY P.A.). To two days later Working on a great shoot that All I had to do was talk with the director, and operate the Camera. The AC and the Grips did all the technical work I asked for( NO lights). It really changes on a job to job basis ( for me), sometimes what I do changes in the middle of the Job, especially if the Director becomes a jerk, and I am working way too hard for no reason ( at that point SUPERHUMAN Steve goes away).\nSteven ( well that's my view of it, You must have a reason for asking this Geoff) Gladstone - wow I even worked a little ranting into my answer\nhttp://members.aol.com/veenotph\nHaving been blessed with the opportunity to work in a wide variety of types of production, eg.16,35,IMAX docs, ride films, corporate, industrial, medical, political, commercial, broadcast sports, brroadcast news, broadcast magazine, broadcast dramatic, music video, indies, and big studio pictures and in many different countries under different types of systems, I would try to define the DP's role using those horrible Venn diagrams of the \"new math\" era, a dark period in US public school education.\nThere is a core set of responsibilites which is, I think, shared by DP's in all types of production (except perhaps non-dramatic and \"soap opera \"multicam studio TV work which has Lighting Directors and operators but often no DP).\nThose responsibilites would include the aesthetic decision-making for lighting, exposure, and filtration and the choice of camera, lenses, and camera support equipment. Past that core, the additional responsibilites seem to depend on both the general type of work and on the specific project team and relationships between them. It seems that in addition to the core responsibilities, the DP will also handle at least one, generally two or three, and sometimes all of the following additional duties: (not ranked by importance)\nTiming/grading of images\nDecisions concerning camera placement and movement (sometimes but not always shared with the Director)\nOperating camera (often delegated to an operator and sometimes usurped by a director)\nTechnical decisions concerning lighting (often shared with the gaffer & key grip, and in a few cases the Director - eg.Stanley and Ridley )\nTechnical decisions concerning equipment used to move and support camera (often shared with the Key grip)\nActor movement and blocking (shared with some directors)\nAesthetic and technical issues concerning set painting and treatment ( in concert with prod designer, art director, director, and in commercials- client)\nChoice of locations and their proposed use\nEditorial decisions concerning scene coverage and/or documentary content (my late mentor Burleigh Wartes was famous for cutting films in the camera, leaving the editor of record tiny little handles)\nSupply of camera, lighting, and grip equipment, and transportation thereof.\nChoice of crew\nContracting and payment of crew (this seems to be diminishing in our liability loaded world)\nSo the diagram which would show all this would have a bunch of amoeba-like figures encompassing various combinations of these responsibilites but with all of them including the aesthetic lighting, exposure, and filtration area.\nI'm sure I missed a bunch, and I know a list is not a definition, but the specifics seem to vary so much.\nMark Weingartner\nTo the incredibly extensive and comprehensive list I would add, simply, that the Cinematographer (I still prefer that title, as opposed to the Director of PHotography, which underscores the Manager aspect of the job, but not the artistic) is the visual author of the film. Yes, much is decided by the director, etc., but if the director's job is to tell a story on film, it is our job to become the audience's eye, to lead or retreat, hide or reveal visual elements of the story. To this end, we have the technos of our craft at our disposal, but without a POINT OF VIEW, the technique is empty. And it is this Point of View that makes us the visual author of the film.\nVittorio Storaro has said this all very eloquently before, to which I'd like to add a quote from Degas: \"One reproduces only that which is striking, that is to say, the necessary. Thus one's recollections and invention are liberated from the tyranny which nature exerts.\" Even when we approach existing light circumstances, the way in which we find and linger on specific details is an authoring of the visual world, which is where the art begins.\nThom Harp\nI had (another) day off today so tried to answer this rugged little question\nA Director of Photography's duty is to;\n1. Design the photography to serve your director's plans and answer the stories purpose- both in fidelity with the best traditions of the craft and your own artistic convictions. Learn the directors personality as best you're able and establish a common photograhic language with him. Understand the script and the proposed style of editing.\n2. Collaborate with fellow dept. heads from the first meeting possible. Stay apprised of the developments in all the depts. that will directly or indirectly effect photography, set function and set efficiency.\n3. Pre-demonstrate the photographic style(s) conclusively from film tests whenever possible. Assess that the photographic design equates with a pragmatic shooting schedule. Be abreast of the release plans of the picture, of likely contingencies and plot the technology routes so principle photography best complies with the final release objective(s). Integrate a plan of quality control and consistency with the lab.\n4. Sign on, fit out and command the camera dept. Be accountable for all action within the dept (camera, lighting and grip crews) Be satisfied that all crew signed on to the production within these depts will answer to the skill level required. Oversee the logistic preparedness of these depts.\n5. Establish the tone on set that best fits your working style. (i.e.insisting that the set is turned over to you after blocking or that the set is quiet when you work or that The Clash is always played while you work). Lead the crew by example and ensure a healthy work place that is safe, respectful and professional (encouraging some esprit d'corps is a valuable service to all). Back up the crew and if needed, demand the above conditions prevail. Likewise demand that the crew back you up with performance.\n6. Meet the schedule. Come prepared to supply the celerity and raw ingenuity demanded to satisfy your artistic want of truth and accuracy. Be flexible to the rapid changes of physical enviornment and/or the director's priorities. Manuevre the mechanical apparatus and personel involved to keep hitting a moving target.\n7. Maintain yourselfself physically with rest, diet and regimen to keep up your stamina. Be attentive to the effect of the schedule on your crew and represent their health and safety conditions to production if neccessary.\n8. Make do with what you have.\n9. Walk your pictures through the post production phases with care - or as arranged by contract and schedule.\nIn the severe words of The Admirality of The Royal Navy when issueing orders to commanders at sea --> \" Hereof nor you nor any of you may fail or you will answer the contrary at your peril.\"\nCaleb \"do or die\" Crosby\nTo me it boils down to this :\nThe role of the Director of Photography in audiovisial production is to assume the full responsability of the image of the project. This includes two main resposabilities/tasks:\n1. To be the first man next to the director in interpreting his story and wishes into concrete projected moving images, as an interpretor, as close as possible matching the CONTENTS of the message the director or author of the project wants to communicate. (this is the creative, artistic part, this takes feeling and talent to accomplish)\n2. To assume the full reponsability over the technical quality of this image (upto final screening if allowed to) (this is the techinical; quality assurance part of the job)\nThe DP, in order to achieve these goals, executes concrete tasks described before in this thread, and the actions to take may vary considerably depending on the needs and nature of the project and the DP and crew themselves.

The CDCR, through Undersecretary of Operations\u00a0Scott Kernan, tried to defend its reckless and indiscriminate use of solitary confinement; it succeeded only in giving an exhibition in government speak. \u201cWhich Way, LA?\u201d host Warren Olney asked Kernan if Pelican Bay prisoners in solitary confinement\u00a0do in fact \u201cspend at least 22 and a half hours every day in windowless, concrete cells, the remaining time alone in concrete exercise yards.\u201d\nParsing Kernan\u2019s answer should have yielded, at some point, either a yes or no. Kernan started by stating that \u201csolitary confinement is a word that\u2019s used . . . loosely . . . \u201d\nBut instead of explaining how he thought the word has been misapplied to Pelican Bay, he just reverted to the talking point that the guys in \u201cthe hole\u201d are the so-called worst of the worst.\n\u201c[t]hese inmates again are the most dangerous gang leaders that we have in the state of California and, let the truth be told, in the nation. So these guys are really truly the most dangerous offenders. So we have definitely\u2014Pelican Bay was built to house the worst of the worst. And it is meant to control their movements considerably. . . . So let\u2019s just be very, very clear that these are bad guys, and so we keep them very controlled. But it is not solitary confinement, nor is it torturous behavior as described by some.\nOk, so these guys are the most dangerous, the worst of the worst. But are they in fact kept in windowless, concrete cells for 22 and a half hours a day?\nA couple minutes later, when Kernan suggested that there was no overcrowding at Pelican Bay because the inmates are housed in single cells, Olney pressed the question one more time: \u201cWell, are those single cells, in fact, windowless concrete cells, and are they required to stay there 22 and a half hours a day?\u201d\nKernan responded: \u201cUm, well, they have programming, I don\u2019t know if I would say 22 hours, 22 and a half hours a day, but, probably very close to that.\u201d This is a sizeable number of words to say, in effect, \u201cyes.\u201d\nWhat could be the point of Kernan\u2019s filibustering other than to avoid the real questions: Does it benefit public safety to house inmates in a concrete box? How do people react to extreme isolation? Is it inhumane to isolate a person in a windowless concrete cell for 22.5 hours a day for months, years, or even decades?\nMr. Kernan elected to end his interview rather than attempt to answer.\nHector Villagra is the Executive Director of the ACLU/SC.\nFull transcript of Mr. Kernan\u2019s radio interview:\nWarren Olney: \u201cScott Kernan is Undersecretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, welcome back to our program. I understand that you helped to resolve some of these issues. Which of those that I listed were in fact dealt with, and did the state make some concessions?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would say concessions; you know, the inmates had a list of demands, we took a look at them, and I think that at the end of the day we realized that as you just described a watch cap in inclement weather and a wall calendar didn\u2019t pose significant security concerns and so those changes were made. We\u2019re also looking at a number of things including the very complicated gang validation process. I\u2019d also just point out to you that the inmates at Pelican Bay that started this are there because of their behavior. These are the gang leaders that are running the various prison gangs and as such are the scourge of society in our prisons. A lot of violence associated with it. So anyway we did evaluate it and we did make some changes to our policy and we\u2019re going to look at the other changes that the inmates desire moving forward.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cWhat about at the other prisons?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cWell really it was, again, generated by inmates at Pelican Bay. So the central issues were related to them and it really is a illustration of the power that these guys represent over other offenders. For at the height of it, six thousand, sixty-five hundred or so, at 13 prisons, although that dissipated very quickly, and really the core hunger strikers were probably under a hundred at Pelican Bay.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cIt\u2019s been reported that at Pelican Bay many prisoners are in solitary confinement, and then when they are they spend at least 22 and a half hours every day in windowless, concrete cells, the remaining time alone in concrete exercise yards, are those things true?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cThe solitary confinement is a word that\u2019s used, I guess, loosely, a little bit. These inmates again are the most dangerous gang leaders that we have in the state of California and, let the truth be told, in the nation. These guys are running the Mexican mafia, the Nuestra Familia, the Black Guerilla family, the Aryan Brotherhood.\u201d So these guys are really truly the most dangerous offenders. So we have definitely\u2014Pelican Bay was built to house the worst of the worst. And it is meant to control their movements considerably. I mean these inmates are not there at Pelican Bay for just not obeying simple rules. They\u2019re in there for murdering inmates, and for you know following through with their criminal enterprises on the street. So let\u2019s just be very, very clear that these are bad guys, and so we keep them very controlled. But it is not solitary confinement, nor is it torturous behavior as described by some.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cThere\u2019s a panel of federal judges that have said the conditions within the prisons violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Did they single out the kind of treatment that I described?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cNo, not at all. The court decision that you described is overall overcrowding in the system, and the fact that Pelican Bay inmates are largely single cell because they\u2019re so dangerous. They\u2019re one of the few areas that we have very reduced overcrowding, while the courts ruled that overall the Department\u2019s population is overcrowded leading to those constitutional violations; it had nothing to do with the SHU specifically at Pelican Bay or any of the other SHUs that we have in the state.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cWell are those single cells, in fact, windowless concrete cells and are they required to stay there 22 and a half hours a day?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cUm, well, they have programming, I don\u2019t know if I would say 22 hours, 22 and a half hours a day, but, probably very close to that. They get an hour a day of yard and showers and if they have to go to they can have visits and go to medical appointments and the like but it is, it is stark correctional environment for our most dangerous offenders.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cMost dangerous as they are, there are those who say that conditions of that kind can produce panic attacks, depression, inability to concentrate, memory loss, aggression, self-mutilation, and various forms of psychosis. Is that true? And even if they are worst of the worst, is it appropriate to have those kinds of consequences?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cInteresting question. The federal courts have been in the Department of corrections and rehabilitations mental health process for a long time and none of the inmates that are involved in this hunger strike at SHU, we don\u2019t allow mental health inmates to be there. So any inmate that had any kind of mental health concern would not be housed in the SHU at Pelican Bay.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cOk, so how long do you think it will take to resolve these other issues with what, you don\u2019t want to call solitary confinement, and also with the question of gang validation which they complain as though I understand it that it takes so long that they\u2019re then accused of being snitches when they get back into the general population or anywhere near it. I suppose if they\u2019re confined to single cells they\u2019re not really in the general population. What about those issues? Will that take you longer to resolve?\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that. What they\u2019re referring to is about the debriefing process is that when an inmate wants to get out of SHU and wants to disassociate himself with the gangs he can do so and he has to go through a debriefing process. And in that debriefing process he must identify criminal behavior that he\u2019s been involved in, and others. The SHU inmates are taking umbrage with that suggestion, that that\u2019s not appropriate. We completely disagree and if you talk to the inmates that have went[sic] through the debriefing process and got out of the gang life, they will tell you that the debriefing process, we get it right a hundred percent of the time. So you know while we\u2019re going to look at all these issues, we definitely think that there could be some changes to the validation and debriefing process but we\u2019re going to do that with the input of not only the stakeholders of the inmate side but the stakeholders of the law enforcement and the gang investigators that work so hard every day to protect our streets and our prisons.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cOkay, well thanks for being on our program.\u201d\nScott Kernan: \u201cThank you.\u201d\nKCRW: \u201cScott Kernan, Undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, elected not to talk with any of our other guests.\u201d\nDid you like this?

IsolationThere is a large amount of intentional and incidental isolation that happens when you are a JW.The advice that bad associations spoil useful gifts is one that is repeated continually.Now, the difficult part is that each and every Jehovah's Witness is brought up in a slightly different way. There is a certain amount of personal interpretation allowed, and there are also cultural differences between different countries.I can only speak for my own experience, and those of the people I knew personally. I grew up in a small town in Australia, and in my early years I doubt I mixed with barely any non-Jehovah\u2019s Witness children, and when I was at school the time I was not at school I primarily spent time with other Jehovah\u2019s Witness children. My Jehovah's Witness friends at the time are some of the most amazing and genuine people I have ever met. 12345 Read more...

The word \u201cevil\u201d keeps getting thrown around to describe my mother. I am always surprised by it. I don\u2019t generally think of people in terms of their actions being evil. So it never occurred to me that maybe my mother\u2019s actions, or inactions, were evil.Generally when I am faced with a question I turn to the books. I do research. So my research this week involved the nature of evil. What it evil? How would I recognize it when and if I saw it? So my first stop is to get the definition of evil. 12345 Read more...

It doesn\u2019t take much digging to uncover a large amount of lies, hypocrisy, ridiculous former beliefs, sweeping things under the carpet, arrogance, and a North Korea approach to running the religion, and playing some pretty serious hardball with anyone who doesn\u2019t play by the rules.Plus a corporate culture where you are rewarded for being obedient, loyal and not shaking up the status quo. Like a sales organization where you are selling a faulty product, initially members seem to buy into the idea, sell it passionately, but after a while you begin to see the flaws in it, and ultimately realize that you have a dud. 12345 Read more...

The law states that the Board of Health has 45 days to review the plan, which expired at the beginning of June. The Board of Health, however, states that the application period had not yet begun, because the application without the fee was not complete.\nMr. Brogna identified\u00a0 the following five waivers that the applicant was requesting, as outlined in his letter dated June 26, 2006:\n1.\u00a0The proposed roadway construction will extend the length of Simmons more than 800'. The Planning Board Rules and Regulations state in Section 4, Design Standards, B (4) (a) that a dead-end street shall not be longer than 800' in length.2.\u00a0Hingham Zoning By-Law, Section 111-C Flood Plan and Watershed Protection District, paragraph 2.a. - \"no building.shall be created.\"\u00a0 It would appear that the proposed location of the dwelling on Lot 1 falls within the 10' MSL contour.\u00a0 The applicant should review Lot 2 for this issue, as well.3.\u00a0Hingham Planning Board Rules and Regulations, Section 4, paragraph C (3) (b) \"manhole inlet and outlet inverts shall be at the same elevation\".4.\u00a0Hingham Planning Board Rules and Regulations, Section 4, paragraph D (Open Drainage Systems) \"in no case shall side slopes in disturbed areas be greater than twenty-five (25) percent 4H:IV\".\u00a0 It would appear that there are areas on the plans that exceed this 25%.5.\u00a0Hingham Planning Board Rules & Regulations, Section 4, paragraph C (3) (g) \"Where the Planning Board determines that the public interest and the best interest of the Town and the subdivision will be served by extension of the drainage system outside the boundaries of the subdivision, the Planning Board may required the Applicant, at his own expense, to continue the layout and construction of the drainage system.\". The extension of the Rice Road drainage system is the issue. The proposed extension of the piping at the end of Rice Road into a stone swale would require a waiver here.\nMs. Murphy asked the Board to consider, given the waivers that the applicant was requesting, whether they were willing to proceed with the hearing and hear the applicant's full presentation. Board members agreed to continue the hearing.\nAl Trakimas provided an overview of the proposed roadway drainage, which would include traditional subsurface pipes leading to two catch basins at the throat of the cu-de sac. Water would flow from the basins into two Vortechnics units and through a series of stepped manholes, ultimately discharging at the wetlands below.\nRoadwork would begin at the two existing catch basins on Simmons Road, where the applicant proposed to saw cut and match the existing pavement. The roadway would slope down to the west at approximately 8% grade, flattening out at the cul-de-sac to 3%. The cul-de-sac would be 120' in width.\nA 4\" water line would be hooked up to the existing 2\" water line on Simmons Road. A new hydrant would be located in the cul-de-sac, serving this new portion of Simmons Road. Mr. Trakimas said that they had looked into the possibility of looping the water line at Rice Road, but that Aquarion Water co. had indicated that this would not be possible.\nMr. Trakimas acknowledged that the project design included several side slopes which exceeded that maximum 2:1 slope. He pointed out, however, that if you just looked at the construction of the roadway, and not the adjacent lots, that the extent of excessive side slopes was greatly reduced. The actual house locations shown on the plans were conceptual in nature, when in fact they could be placed in other locations. Board members questioned the logic behind taking this approach towards the review of the project, and Mr. Devin responded that \"you have to start somewhere\" in terms of project approval. Paul Healey asked if this would mean that house foundations would have to be built into the fill put in place to create the elevation for the roadway. Mr. Trakimas responded that it might.\nPaul Healey asked what the downside of the proposed \"stepped manholes\" would be in terms of the functionality of the drainage system. Al responded that this type of stepped system is common for sewer systems. Susan Murphy asked Paul Brogna to look into this and report back at the next meeting.\nAl Trakimas finished up by stating that utility companies had all been contacted, and had provided their preliminary approval of the plans.\nJudy Sneath asked whether the construction of the roadway would impact the single family lot owned by D'Allesandro on the south side of Simmons Road adjacent to the proposed subdivision. Mr. Trakimas responded that the grading for the roadway would cut into this property. Ms. Sneath expressed concern about the quality of the filled soil on that lot. Paul Brogna was instructed to look into industry standards for the type of soil permitted for side slopes.\nJudy Sneath and Paul Healey asked why this lot was not part of the subdivision. Mr. Devin explained that it would be a legal Form A lot should the road be extended.\nTod McGrath asked about the quantity of fill that would be required to build this project. Mr. Trakimas responded that if the house lots were to be built it would require 7000 cubic yards of cut and 17000 cubic yards of fill. To bring in the fill would require 400-600 dump trucks of fill to be brought to the site. For just the roadway to be built it would require 2,300 cubic yards of cut, and 7,000 cubic yards of fill, or a net of 5,000 cubic yards of fill (200-400 dump trucks). He explained that a staging area would be created to the dump trucks to turn around.\nSusan Murphy pointed out that if houses were to be built on these lots they would require a variance from the height by-law in that the bottom of the basement slab would be more than five feet above the existing grade. She pointed out that subdivisions can be denied if they assume noncompliance with zoning.\u00a0 Tod McGrath asked why the developer would want to proceed with this project when they might only get to develop one lot. Susan Murphy asked if they could build the project without the waivers. Al Trakimas responded that it would be very difficult, but that it could be done using extensive retaining walls. Susan reiterated her concern about how the Fee's property would be impacted by the extension of Simmons Road, and pointed out that the Subdivision Control specifically states that new subdivisions linking to existing subdivisions cannot damage or harm the properties on the existing roadways.\nAbutters expressed concern about the impacts of construction on the neighborhood during construction including truck traffic and noise, damage to a public way, disruption and removal of potentially toxic materials, and difficulty for emergency access.\nThe hearing was continued to July 24 at 8:00 PM.\nRE:\u00a0 South Shore Baptist Church, 20 Free Street Continuation of Public Hearing - Special Permit A-3: Parking Determination\nPresent for the applicant: Robert Pomereine, Attorney and Brad Warner, President of the Board of Elders. This was a continuation of a hearing initiated on June 13, 2006.\nThe applicant is currently applying for a Special Permit A-3 (parking determination) in connection with a change of use of the property at 20 Free Street from a residence to church offices. The applicant is requesting 1) a determination under Section V-A that the applicant may provide all parking required for 20 Free Street at 578 Main Street, with the exception of handicapped access parking, and 2) a determination that the proposed use of the property at 20 Free will NOT intensify the church use (and thus the required parking for the property as a whole), as the church contests that the new office space will simply replace operations that will be housed at 20 Free are already in existence in the church and 3) approval of the Site Plan showing modifications to the property at 20 Free Street.\nMs. Murphy opened the hearing by noting that letters had been received by Pat MacAllen and Jim MacAllen expressing concern with the proposed use of 20 Free Street for church office use. Ms. Murphy also followed up with a report from Ms. Lacy regarding past Special Permits issued for the church indicating that there were no conflicts between the request currently before the Board and existing permits. She noted that the when the church received a parking determination in 1987 indicating that 150 parking spaces was sufficient, and that they now have 175 spaces. While the church population may have increased, in terms of how parking needs are required (by number of seats and square footage of office/classroom use) the church still complied with this original determination.\nBrad Warner presented the revised site plan showing a pervious paved walkway located approximately 25' from the western property line, and vegetative screening on the western property boundary with the adjacent house. He explained that screening was not put in on the other side due to the presence of existing vegetation and the fact that the garage for the abutting property was located right on the property line blocking views.\u00a0 Mr. Warner reiterated that the use of the building did not represent an increase in the intensity of use at the church, but simply a relocation of uses from the church building to 20 Free Street.\nAbutter Mary Ellen McCabe noted that she wanted screening along the entire length of her property.\nAt 8:45 Paul Healey made a motion to close the hearing, and vote to issue the Special Permit A3 with conditions. Tod McGrath seconded the motion and all approved.\nThe Board began deliberations on the proposed conditions to the permit. Board members agreed that the request for relief from the requirements of the parking by-law was appropriate, and that there was sufficient parking at the church to serve the uses that would be housed in the church and at 20 Free Street. They recognized that the use of the building did not represent an increase in the intensity of use at the church, but simply a relocation of uses from the church building to 20 Free Street.\nMr. Healey acknowledged that the path leading from the church to the house at 20 Free Street could represent an invasion of privacy for the neighbors by inviting the public into the traditionally private realm of backyards. Board members determined that additional screening should be provided on the west side of the property to screen the abutters at 22 Free Street.\nBoard members discussed the potential difficulties associated with enforcing many of the conditions proposed by the abutters associated with the use of the property during non-business hours and by groups of adults. Tod McGrath pointed out that the proposed building layout, consisting of small office spaces, did not seem conducive to group gatherings. Judy Sneath felt that placing too many constraints on uses would, in effect, turn the neighbors into \"spies\" having to check and determine whether the activity was permitted or not.\nMr. Warner reiterated that persons using the 20 Free Street building in the evenings and at all other times will be expected to respect the interests of neighbors, as would any good neighbor.\nThe Board voted to attach the following conditions to the Special Permit A-3:\u00a01.\u00a0A 4-foot path surfaced with a \"nonpermanent\", plowable surface such as brick or paving stones will be installed from the house at 20 Free Street to the main parking lot at 578 Main Street. The path will be located as shown on the Site Plan of the 20 Free Street property last revised 6/14/06.\n2.\u00a0Path lighting will be limited to low level lights located at ground level. Prior to installation, proposed walkway lighting will be reviewed by the Town Planner.\n3.\u00a0The intermittent porch light on the east side of the building illuminating the driveway will be replaced with a lower wattage fixture pointing downwards and away from abutting properties.\n4.\u00a0Vegetative screening shall be planted along the west property lines for approximately 150' from Free Street northward to a point parallel to the shed at 22 Free Street.\n5.\u00a0Parking at 20 Free Street will be limited to the one American Disabilities Act compliant parking space as shown on the plans. Parking will not be permitted on the grass lawn areas in front or in back of the building at 20 Free Street.\n6.\u00a0Use of the building at 20 Free Street will be limited to the following:\na.\u00a0office and/or desk space for 4-7 Church pastors and staff for pastoral, clerical and administrative functions, space for pastors, staff, church officers and elders to meet with church members and other persons for Church business and ministry activities, and space for storage of supplies and other church property;\nb.\u00a0visits to pastors or other church staff by members of the congregation and other visitors including those inquiring about becoming involved with the church, for prayer, Bible reading, obtaining advice, mentoring and information, Biblical teaching, and other church-related purposes;\nc.\u00a0normal week-day business hours on Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM;\nd.\u00a0use at other times as needed on weekends and in the evenings for church office activities as described above, in particular pastors working on evenings or week ends studying or preparing sermons or meeting with people, and church pastors officers, staff and elders conducting church business and ministry activities, and making copies, retrieving files, and making phone calls.\n7.\u00a0There will be no indoor or outdoor infant, child or youth group activities at 20 Free Street.\n8. \u00a0The church will have an open door to the neighbors about any nuisance or disorder that may arise from the use of 20 Free Street, and will work with the neighbors and the Town to resolve any issues in a mutually agreeable manner.\n9.\u00a0Prior to the issuance of the building permit a revised Site Plan will be submitted to the Planning Board and Building Commissioner reflecting all applicable conditions identified herein.\nThe hearing was closed.\nRE:\u00a0 309 Whiting-Request for Lot Release\nMr. David Bowering came before the Board to request the release of the lot at 309 Whiting Street. The Board's consulting engineer, Paul Brogna, had inspected the site, and prepared a \"cost to complete\" indicating that a bond in the amount of $3,500 would be sufficient to cover the cost of completing the roadway plus contingencies.\nIt was moved, seconded and SO VOTED, to release Lot 2 (Land Court lots 3, 4 and 5) from the Subdivision at 309 Whiting Street, contingent upon the applicant posting a bond in the amount of $3,500.\nRE:\u00a0 Viking Lane-Request for Extension to 8/1/07Ms. Lacy requested that the Board postpone this vote until she get a better sense whether they have appropriately dealt with erosion control on the cleared site. Ms. Murphy asked how many times this project had been extended, and Ms. Lacy noted that it was approved in 2001. Ms. Murphy asked that Mr. Murphy to come before the Board at a meeting in the near future to discuss why the project has not been moving forward.\nUnscheduled:\u00a0Old/New Business\nRE:\u00a0 Form A - 400 Cushing Street, Boston Golf Jeffery Tocchio presented this Form A to the Board on behalf of applicant John Mineck.\nThis Form A would create a house lot within the Boston Golf Club. John Mineck has conferred with the Board of Appeals, and the creation of this new lot will require a modification to the Special Permit for Boston Golf. He will be held to this before a building permit is issued for the new house.\nIt was moved, seconded, and SO VOTED, to accept the Form A entitled, \"Approval Not Required Plan of Land 400 Cushing Street Hingham, MA\u00a0 02043\", dated June 9, 2006, prepared by Coler and Colantonio, Inc., Norwell, MA, for John DeMatteo II, 405 Cochituate Road, Suite 203, Framingham, MA, owner and John Mineck, 289 Whiting Street, Hingham, MA, applicant.\nRE:\u00a0 Review Proposed Minor Modification to Back River CondosMs. Hastings proposed a minor modification to the Back River Condos to the ZBA, and they requested that the Planning Board take a look to make sure that it would not require Site Plan Review. The change involved moving one unit from one 4-unit complex to an adjacent 3-unit complex.

Acer on Wednesday in a statement\nsaid that it has no plans to phase out netbooks as it increases its focus on tablets.\nThe company also said that it does not foresee tablets based on Sandy Bridge processors,\ncontrary to comments made earlier this week by an Acer sales manager in Taiwan.\nLu Bing-hsian earlier this week told the IDG News Service that Acer would begin\nselling new tablet PCs in the first half of this year as it gradually phases out\nnetbooks and that tablets would come with processors based on Intel's Sandy Bridge\nmicroarchitecture. \"For the moment it is not foreseen yet ... devices based\non Sandy Bridge,\" Acer said.

More than one made best of collections\nin the year it was published. Al Sarrantonio set out to collect only\nhigh quality stories, and even had the rather lofty goal of starting\nanother upsurge in horror sales. While he didn\u2019t necessarily succeed\nat all he set out to do, this IS an extremely solid collection that\nbelongs on the shelf of all serious horror fans. Joe Lansdale\u2019s\n\u201cMad Dog Summer\u201d is the best of a very impressive lot, and\nI also greatly enjoyed William Peter Blatty\u2019s short novel Elsewhere.\nOddly enough, I wasn\u2019t as impressed with several stories by authors\nwho I am a fan of, including TED Klein\u2019s \u201cGrowing Things\u201d\nand Thomas Ligotti\u2019s \u201cThe Shadow, The Darkness\u201d, though\nI\u2019m sure a lot of you will disagree with me as to the quality\nof those and other tales in the list below.\n\"Amerikanski Dead at the Moscow Morgue\"\nBy Kim Newman\nRating: 7/10\nQuote: \"It was important, apparently, that the spike entirely transfix\nthe skull and break ground, binding the dead to the earth, allowing\nthe last of the spirit to leave the carcass.\"\nComments: What do Rasputin\u2019s skull, dead tourists come back to\nlife, and a prominent member of the Soviet government have to do with\none another in an apocalyptic future? One whole hell of a lot apparently!\n\"The Ruins of Contracoeur\"\nBy Joyce Carol Oates\nRating: 8/10\nQuote: \"I can't believe it! I know it must be true.\"\nComments: The Matheson family, especially the children, are paying\nfor past crimes of their family. These crimes only become clear after\na long, lonely, somehow OFF summer at rural Cross Hill, ancestral home\nof the Mathesons.\n\"The Owl and the Pussycat\"\nBy Thomas M. Disch\nRating: 7/10\nQuote: \"But you know he didn't kill Mrs. Fairfield.\"\nComments: At first I didn't like this one much, but the ending is a\nnice little shocker.\n\"The Road Virus Heads North\"\nBy Stephen King\nRating: 8/10\nQuote: \"Survivors and visitors.\"\nComments: Famous horror author Richard Kinnell quickly enough comes\nto regret buying a painting with certain, shall we say, DISTURBING properties.\n\"Keepsakes and Treasures: A Love Story\"\nBy Neil Gaiman\nRating: 9/10\nQuote: \"Not my cup of tea.\"\nComments: The narrator is one cold-hearted bastard...and that's being\nnice!\n\"Growing Things\"\nBy T. E. D. Klein\nRating: 5/10\nQuote: \"Before it was just one bulge.\"\nComments: I've heard many good things about Klein, but I didn't particularly\ncare for this one. The reader is forced to jump to too many conclusions\nfor this house to be the one which appears in the home improvement magazines.\n\"Good Friday\"\nBy F. Paul Wilson\nRating: 7/10\nQuote: \"It's too late for me, but not for you.\"\nComments: I've heard of cheerleaders becoming vampire hunters, but\nnuns? I like it.\n\"Excerpts from the Records of the New Zodiac and the Diaries of\nHenry Wilson Fairfax\"\nBy Chet Williamson\nRating: 9/10\nQuote: \"\u2026it has been easy to buy them out and swallow them\nup in their weakened condition.\"\nComments: Brother Capricorn\u2019s New Zodiac Club isn\u2019t showing\nthe civility he had desired in his club members. And to make matters\nworse, their eating habits are a bit peculiar as well\u2026\n\"An Exaltation of Termagants\"\nBy Eric Van Lustbader\nRating: 7/10\nQuote: \"But I was so cruel to you.\"\nComments: William gets a chance to look over his life from an unlikely\nsource.\n\"Itinerary\"\nBy Tim Powers\nRating: 5/10\nQuote: \"Is Doug Olney there?...He just left.\"\nComments: I didn\u2019t really get this one. It apparently involves\na man trying to warn himself of impending disaster through a phone call.\n\"Catfish Gal Blues\"\nBy Nancy A. Collins\nRating: 8/10\nQuote: \"Lit'l Fishie--is that you?\"\nComments: Hop Armstrong has a way with the ladies, even non-human ladies.\nHe should've made sure she didn't have a boyfriend first though.\n\"The Entertainment\"\nBy Ramsey Campbell\nRating: 6/10\nQuote: \"You've been caught, you have to play.

But it's going to take time and probably more than one body...\n\"The Shadow, The Darkness\"\nBy Thomas Ligotti\nRating: 5/10\nQuote: \"In other words, I became aware of what in reality was activating\nmy body.\"\nComments: This one is VERY Lovecraftian in tone and outlook, something\nI normally enjoy. In other words, mere human beings do not stand a chance\nagainst the cosmic forces arrayed against us, and there is no use trying.\nHowever, I just didn't like the actual story very much.\n\"Knocking\"\nBy Rick Hautala\nRating: 5/10\nQuote: \"Let...me...out!\"\nComments: This story of a human mind gone wrong wasn't my cup of tea.\n\"Rio Grande Gothic\"\nBy David Morrell\nRating: 8/10\nQuote: \"I hate him.\"\nComments: Officer Romero can't shake the feeling that things aren't\nquite right with the Parsons brothers. He's the only one who suspects\nthem, and his efforts uncover a dark secret.\n\"Des Saucisses, Sans Doute\"\nBy Peter Schneider\nRating: 4/10\nQuote: \"My God! Did I do that?\"\nComments: This was a shorter than short story, and it wasn't very good.\n\"Angie\"\nBy Ed Gorman\nRating: 7/10\nQuote: \"You know if there's a river around here somewhere?\"\nComments: Angie at first looks like a sort of heroine, but this IS a\nhorror story, after all.\n\"The Ropy Thing\"\nBy Al Sarrantonio\nRating: 6/10\nQuote: \"I don't love you anymore.\"\nComments: If you believe in something hard enough, it just might come\ntrue.\n\"The Tree Is My Hat\"\nBy Gene Wolfe\nRating: 5/10\nQuote: \"The tree is my hat.\"\nComments: Baden is sent to the end of the earth, an island in the Pacific,\nwhere he sees and hears strange things.\n\"Styx and Bones\"\nBy Edward Bryant\nRating: 6/10\nQuote: \"Danny, I'll love you forever.

Al Sarrantonio says this reminds him of a Twilight Zone episode, and I\nhave to very much agree.\n\u201cDarkness\u201d\nBy Dennis L. McKiernan\nRating: 9/10\nQuote: \u201cMy God, it\u2019s behind me!\u201d\nComments: Harlow Winton has gone from an orphan to a wealthy man overnight.\nHis great-uncle left everything to him\u2026including his peculiar\nhouse where SOMETHING lurked in the darkness.

Known for his early successes, charisma and good looks, Lima became a professional in 2002, though he has never reached any considerable level of success in the United States or the PGA. With four professional wins, Lima has won as an individual and has been recruited for various teams and championships over his career.\nGolf Tee Times\nGolf Travel Packages\nGolf Resorts\nCar Rentals\nGolf Vacations\nGolf Retail Stores\nFlight Deals\nDiscount Golf Clubs\nGolf Swing Improvement\nSponsored Links\nEarly Years\nLima was born on Nov. 26, 1981, in Versailles, France. His parents introduced him to golf at early age, and he hit his first golf balls as a 2-year-old growing up on the course at the Saint-Nom-la-Breteche Golf Club, the home course of the Trophee Lancome golf tournament. His first golf club was made by his father, who had a large influence on teaching him the game in his early years.\nBeginning in Golf\nThough both parents are Portuguese, Lima and his family spent his early years in France. He entered formal golf training when he attended the golf school at Saint-Nom-la-Breteche as a 7-year-old. It was at this point that his interest in golf escalated to a true passion, and he and his parents began to focus much of his time on the sport.\nEarly Career\nBy the end of 2001, the 20-year-old Lima had escalated his game to the top spot on the French amateur scene. He turned professional early the following year for the beginning of the season. He golfed for France for the first three years of his career, using the name Jose Filipe. His first professional post was on the Alps Tour in central Europe, where he moved up to the No. 4\nranking by the next year.\nSuccess\nHis high ranking in the Alps Tour earned him a spot on the more-coveted Challenger Tour for the beginning of the 2004 season. Though he had success on the Alps Tour, he gained his first tournament win at the Segura Viudas Challenge of Spain. Soon after he began to represent Portugal, instead of France, on the tour and re-adopted his birth name. He went on to win the AA St. Amer Open in 2004.\nRise in the World Rankings\nAfter his 2004 success, Lima rose to be the 73rd-ranked player in the European Tour classification and became the highest-ranked Portuguese player ever in 2005. His play in two years on the European Tour earned him his tour card for 2007, and his other wins over this time included the 2004 and 2005 Masters on the Alps Tour. He has also tied for 70th at the PGA Open Championship and been a member of Continental Europe for the St. Andrews Trophy and played with Portugal at the WGC-World Cup in 2005.\nAbout The Author\nMatthew Fortuna is a full-time freelance writer with a journalism degree from Wayne State University, living in the Detroit metropolitan area.\nHe has written about a wide range of topics across varying publications, including Demand Studios, wiseGEEK.com and Suite101.com, among others.

I'm usually inclined to think very much not, but there were times while watching the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas in The Edge Of Love when I felt myself being coaxed into seeing a simple solution to the labyrinthine problems of human relationships: cull the oversensitive creatives, and all would be smooth and right.\nI'm sure I wasn't supposed to like Thomas, who's played by Matthew Rhys, but I'm not sure if I was supposed to dislike him quite as much as I did.\n\"I do it, sleep with other women, because I'm a poet and I feed off life,\" he tells his wife, Caitlin MacNamara (Sienna Miller).\nOf course, you could still just about get away with saying that kind of thing with a straight face in 1942, but it's a bit rich coming from a bloke who looks like a losing quarter finalist in a regional Rufus Sewell-lookalike competition and whose poetic contributions of the previous hour have included the ingenious rhyming of the name \"Vera\" with \"Beera\".\nThe Edge Of Love tells the story of the menage a trois between Thomas, Caitlin and his childhood sweetheart Vera (Keira Knightley) and, as such, comes across as a kind of Jules Et Jim for readers of Hello! magazine.\nActually, it's more of a menage a quatre, since loitering on the edge of the threesome is a beleaguered Cillian Murphy, who plays Vera's husband William.\nNot only is William by some way the most attractive of these four people; he also has by far the most reasons to feel good about himself.\nWhile Dylan spends his money and tries it on with his missus, William must go and fight for his country. But, even given the role of the mug, Murphy has a psychotic twinkle in his eye that few directors can resist taking advantage of.\nWhen William comes back to the bleak Welsh coast scarred by his war experiences in Greece, matters come to a head. That head has a prominent jaw, and belongs to Miss Knightley.\nIf you've found Knightley annoying before, the chances are that in this film, directed by John Maybury, you'll find her doubly so. Not only has she hit upon the ugliest Welsh accent imaginable, her preening and pouting has reached a new low.\nWorse, it appears to be catching. In a scene where she and Miller\u2014normally an actress much more effortlessly capable of the kind of old-fashioned lens-flirting Knightley seems so frantic to achieve\u2014loll on a bed together in a faux-lesbian manner, there's a genuine worry, just for a moment, that the two of them will merge and become one giant jutting, gurning lower-face.\n\"What does it mean when she smiles?\" one of those closest to Vera asks of her early on, and one senses it's a question Knightley would struggle to answer herself.\nIf anyone was hoping that this would be a neat World War II companion piece to last year's excellent Atonement\u2014the only film, to my knowledge, where Knightley has ever really relaxed into herself\u2014they'll be disappointed.\nThe one thing The Edge Of Love does have going for it is a sense of the urgency of love during wartime; the feeling that the rules change and decisions are made more hastily.\nThat the people involved in this love are largely tedious facsimiles of humankind, however, dulls the impact somewhat. You know you're in trouble when they start referring to each other by their full names (\"Vera Phillips\"): so often a sign of a screenplay clawingly desperate for romantic credence.\n\"All you've got is stories in your head, words,\" Caitlin tells Dylan during one of their many rows. \"And I have to be real.\" But sadly the relationship between Caitlin and Dylan's words seems unreal too: you're never quite convinced as to why his poems cause her to overlook his thickening, selfish form and endure his philandering.\nOn the occasions when he reads his work to her, she just looks bored, and the scene where they fight after she flushes one of his first drafts down the toilet feels like a caricature of tempestuous artistry.\nThe central point of the movie is adequately conveyed\u2014that Thomas's \"pain\" is a piddling, childish thing next to the stuff William has experienced on the front line (most notably the DIY\n", "index": [[815, 820], [826, 838], [842, 858], [1078, 1084], [1102, 1114], [1284, 1301], [1303, 1316], [1522, 1534], [1741, 1747], [1749, 1756], [1792, 1807], [1849, 1861], [1877, 1883], [1998, 2012], [2192, 2197], [2328, 2334], [2458, 2463], [2504, 2510], [2587, 2596], [2614, 2623], [2688, 2700], [2899, 2905], [3000, 3009], [3332, 3341], [3423, 3435], [3525, 3534], [3611, 3627], [4121, 4128], [4135, 4140], [4232, 4239], [4244, 4249], [4672, 4678], [4796, 4799]], "wikipedia_ids": [69894, 8783, 7471088, 8783, 2615928, 4709163, 1091334, 1361048, 8783, 4709163, 249897, 2158246, 1122016, 481634, 8783, 481634, 69894, 12108, 249897, 249897, 6354255, 1091334, 249897, 249897, 32927, 249897, 7471088, 4709163, 8783, 4709163, 8783, 8783, 42719], "wikipedia_titles": ["Wales", "Dylan Thomas", "The Edge of Love", "Dylan Thomas", "Matthew Rhys", "Caitlin Thomas", "Sienna Miller", "Rufus Sewell", "Dylan Thomas", "Caitlin Thomas", "Keira Knightley", "Jules and Jim", "Hello!

He had a semi-prehensile tail and had human level dexterity in his hands and use of his arms. He was amphibious and could expel radioactive flame from his mouth at will. He demonstrated a near-human level of intelligence and understanding.\nHe was later mutated into a more amphibious form, and it is not certain how this affected his abilities. He has not be seen to use his radioactive flame in this form.\nGodzilla is believed to be a dinosaur who somehow survived in an inert form below the surface of the ocean until the modern era. He is believed to have been mutated by nuclear weapons testing. It is also possible that Godzilla is actually a mutate created by the Deviants of Lemuria, as many of the other giant monsters from his era have been found to be active over several of the last decades. For instance, the Deviants created a race of dinosaurs that dwell in Wakanda.\nGodzilla was first seen when he surfaced off the coast of Japan in 1956, during nuclear testing. Dr. Yuriko Takaguchi was present during this testing as a passive resistant and witnessed Godzilla's arrival. Godzilla rampaged through the city of Tokyo on more than one occasion. Other monsters, similarly revived by the nuclear testing, also surfaced and attacked Tokyo, and Godzilla fought several of these creatures.Credit - The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\nAppearancesAdd comic books in which this monster has appeared in.New Battle Top ResultsZach RamirezEnter Battle!FriendsEnemies\nRelated NewsGodzilla Legends #4 preview\nAn epic single issue story shining a light on another terrifying Toho monster!

It is difficult to be\npatient while waiting on entities outside the College to complete\ntasks. Lance and the APDesign guys have been wonderful, catering to\nour every wish, fitting our jobs into their very busy summer of\nrenovation and construction.\nThe summer hours for Weigel Library are: Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to\n5 p.m. and closed weekends.\nFor the academic year beginning Monday, August 22, Weigel Library will be\nopen 77 hours per week: Monday through Thursday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.,\nFriday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 1 to 5 p.m. and Sunday 2 to 10 p.m.\nHours of operation are listed on the Weigel Library website:\nhttp://www.lib.k-state.edu/branches/arch/archhours.html\nEight APDesign students have been hired to work in Weigel Library during\nthe fall semester to provide assistance to library patrons: Amanda\nVan Scoy (ARCH), Anne Denney (LA/RCP), Caleb Melchior (LA/RCP), Emily\nKruse (IAPD), Lauren Ewald (LA/RCP), Rachel Lehr (ARCH), Victoria\nBeaulieu (IAPD), and Will Woodard (LA/RCP). We are very fortunate to\nhave these outstanding students on our staff.\nPlease remember to join us for the Weigel Library Open House from 2 to 4\np.m.\nThursday, August 18, in Seaton 323.\nRegnier Visiting Chair Named for 2011-12\nWendell Burnette of Wendell Burnette Architects in Phoenix, Arizona, has been\nnamed the Regnier Visiting Chair for the 2011-12 academic year.\nBurnette is a self-taught architect with an internationally recognized body of\nwork. His architectural practice is engaged in a wide range of\nprivate and public projects. Burnette\u2019s work is concerned with\nspace, light, context, and community. He is a native of Nashville,\nTennessee, who discovered the southwest desert as an apprentice at\nFrank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Taliesin West. His eleven-year association\nwith the studio of Will Bruder culminated in a six-year design\ncollaboration on the Phoenix Central Library. He is an assistant\nprofessor at Arizona State University and lectures widely in the\nUnited States and abroad. Current projects include residences located\nlocally and nationally, the Palo Verde Library/Maryvale Community\nCenter, the Phoenix Children\u2019s Museum, the Scottsdale Teen Center,\nand a hotel/spa resort in southern Utah. His design philosophy is\ngrounded in listening and distilling the essence of a project to\ncreate highly specific architecture that is at once functional and\npoetic. The firm\u2019s website is:\nhttp://www.wendellburnettearchitects.com/.\nBurnette will make his first visit to campus for a lecture at 4:30 p.m.\nMonday, Sept. 12 in the Leadership Studies Town Hall.\nBuilding UpdatesIf you\nare looking for Architecture Professor Magyar, Interior Architecture\n& Product Design Professor Richter-O\u2019Connell, or Landscape\nArchitecture/Regional & Community Planning Professor Beamish, you\nneed not look any further than the new suite of offices in Seaton\n251. The classroom that once was housed in this space has been\nrelocated to Seaton 305. Seaton 251 now is filled with office\nfurniture and faculty from each of our three departments. Please come\nvisit Professor Magyar in his new \u201chome\u201d and welcome newly hired\ntenure-track faculty \u2014 Professors Richter-O\u2019Connell and Beamish \u2014\nto APDesign.\nAdditionally, the laser cutter space is being expanded. Seaton Court 106E will\ncontinue to house the two laser cutters. Seaton Court 106D will now\nbe a layout area for pieces produced by the laser cutter.\nThe roof is finally being installed over Seaton Court 107 and the old heliodon\nspace in the Link. We are awaiting the arrival of the CNC router to\ncomplete the project with new windows and siding on the east wall of\nthat space.\nRecruitment Reminders\nThe annual APDesign Ambassador meeting will be at 3:30 p.m. Sunday,\nAugust 21, in the Pierce Commons. The APDesign Ambassadors are\nsecond- through fifth-year APDesign students. They represent APDesign\nin many ways: volunteering to be mentors for first year students,\ngiving tours to prospective students, helping with recruitment\nevents, etc. APDeisgn has more than 200 Ambassadors.\nAll new ENVD studio and planning students have been invited to a meet their\nAPDesign mentors at 5 p.m. Sunday, August 21, in the Pierce Commons.\nThe mentor program began as a grassroots effort. Today, the group is\nstill a grassroots organization, but they receive logistical support\nfrom the Dean\u2019s Office/Student Services. Any APDesign ambassador\nmay volunteer to be a mentor. This program has helped with the\nretention of our students by easing the nervous feelings associated\nwith the first day of classes. Mentors are asked to stay in contact\nwith their mentees throughout the fall semester. APDesign has more\nthan 100 mentors.\nK-State\nFirst\u2019s Guide to Personal Success (GPS) program is seeking K-State\nfaculty/staff/graduate students interested in serving as a guide for\ntwo to four first-year students during the 2011-2012 school year.\nYou will not necessarily be assigned to APDesign students. You can\nlearn more at: www.k-state.edu/gps/\nThe University will be hosting many events for new students during the\nK-State Week of Welcome. APDesign will host a donut breakfast outside\nthe Chang Gallery from 8 to 9:30 a.m. on the first day of classes.

He organized a symposium, \u201cLived Relationalities among Place,\nSpace, and Environmental Embodiment.\u201d The three symposium\npresenters were health sociologist\u00a0Andrew Moore, a research\nassociate with the Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre at Keele University in Staffordshire, England; Urban historian\u00a0Sam\nGriffiths, a lecturer in urban morphology and theory at University College London\u2019s Bartlett School of Architecture; and Seamon, whose\npresentation was titled, \u201c\u2018Seeing\u2019 Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nPerception: Possibilities in the Urban Photographs of New York City\nPhotographer Saul Leiter.\u201d\nFrom the Provost: New Faculty Awards Website\nAs the fall 2011 semester is just around the corner, I wanted to take\nthis time to introduce a new initiative of the Office of the Provost.\nOne of the metrics of our vision of K-State 2025 concerns the number\nof faculty members who receive national awards. In the past years,\nK-State has had very few faculty members receive such awards. Part of\nthe problem is that very few faculty members have been nominated or\nhave applied for these awards. We believe we have many outstanding\nscholars at K-State, and such awards are only possible if we nominate\nthem.\nMy office has put together a website\n\u2014\u00a0http://www.k-state.edu/provost/resources/natlawards.htm\u00a0\u2014\nthat lists all of these prestigious national awards, providing a\ndescription, eligible areas and faculty ranks, and the award website\nfor more information on their application process. The awards are\nlisted chronologically by their application deadlines.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We\nwanted to make this information available early enough so that\nfaculty, department heads, and deans can have adequate time to\nprepare nominations and applications. We hope that this information\nwill generate the interest necessary so that our top scholars from\nacross the university will be considered for and eventually receive\nthese prestigious awards.\nIt should be noted that the awards are not only for longtime scholars.\nThey vary in terms of content areas (e.g., humanities, sciences, art,\nor biomedicine) as well as nominee rank (full professor, mid-career\nprofessor, early career scholar, or post-doctoral). Therefore, please\npay close attention to the eligibility for the awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\nurge each of you to examine the complete list of awards and\ndeadlines, consider possible nominees in your area, and make every\neffort possible to forward their names in nomination. My office will\nprovide as much support as we can, and will be happy to write letters\nof support as needed.\nThank you for your assistance in this important initiative.\nMonsters of Design Competition\nAre you a monster?

They easily chased their target and achieved it in the 35th over with the loss of just two wickets.\nThe key wickets were taken by Mendis. In his opening spell he removed two hard-hitting Indian batsmen Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Dhoni. Yuvraj Singh was the top scorer making 23 runs; whereas Muralitharan made attack on the lower order Indian batting line.\nVirat Kohli substituted Sehwag who took injury on his ankle on Sunday. It was his debut match.\nThe start of the game was really dreaming for Sri Lankans; when left-arm medium paced bowler Chaminda Vaas removed the Indian opener Gautam Gambhir on the very second delivery of the match. The delivery moved sharply into the wickets and hit the off-stump.\nPaceman Nuwan Kulasekara was also leading bowler; he took 2 for giving 23 runs. He bowled out kohli at 12 for lbw and later got rid of Suresh Raina.\nYuvraj was given a chance when his catch was dropped by Mahela Jayawardene at slip.\nBut soon he was bowled off.\nThe innings remained one-sided and Jayawardene\u2019s unbeaten 61 runs ended the contest with Sri Lankan success.\nScores:\nSri Lanka 147-2\nIndia\n", "index": [[130, 133], [1041, 1050], [1052, 1066], [1071, 1091], [1132, 1141], [1161, 1166], [1212, 1220], [1232, 1238], [1243, 1255], [1342, 1348], [1375, 1385], [1399, 1411], [1485, 1491], [1564, 1573], [1590, 1605], [1696, 1706], [1742, 1752], [1892, 1898], [1949, 1955], [1964, 1976], [1981, 1995], [1997, 2009], [2053, 2065], [2097, 2103], [2118, 2129], [2142, 2148], [2259, 2270], [2306, 2319], [2332, 2338], [2346, 2360], [2478, 2494], [2605, 2617], [2619, 2625], [2675, 2693], [2766, 2777], [2820, 2830], [2848, 2857], [2864, 2869]], "wikipedia_ids": [13260340, 397246, 16962266, 20905, 397246, 407754, 369643, 16962266, 20905, 16962266, 26750, 20905, 14533, 397246, 25151882, 26750, 26750, 16962266, 14533, 438714, 1695229, 438714, 20905, 14533, 16017429, 25151882, 26750, 198062, 14533, 25144456, 894394, 2267612, 438714, 1160688, 1160688, 26750, 397246, 407754], "wikipedia_titles": ["Indian Premier League", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Ajantha Mendis", "Muttiah Muralitharan", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "India national cricket team", "Dambulla", "Ajantha Mendis", "Muttiah Muralitharan", "Ajantha Mendis", "Sri Lanka", "Muttiah Muralitharan", "India", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "Virender Sehwag", "Sri Lanka", "Sri Lanka", "Ajantha Mendis", "India", "Yuvraj Singh", "MS Dhoni", "Yuvraj Singh", "Muttiah Muralitharan", "India", "Virat Kohli", "Virender Sehwag", "Sri Lanka", "Chaminda Vaas", "India", "Gautam Gambhir", "Nuwan Kulasekara", "Suresh Raina", "Yuvraj Singh", "Mahela Jayawardene", "Mahela Jayawardene", "Sri Lanka", "Sri Lanka national cricket team", "India national cricket team"]}

These days both husbands and wives can expect to bounce from job to job and even career to career several times before they'll have enough free time to watch old Ozzie and Harriet reruns.\nI have a friend named Lynn, age 63, who was a systems engineer at IBM and later a senior systems analyst for Lockheed in Southern California. After over 20 years in information technology, she spent a decade overseas with her engineer husband as a housewife. When she tried to get back into the computer job market upon returning to the states, she was shut out. So she started a new life in her mid 50s by attending nursing school and becoming a nurse.\nI have a friend named Campbell, age 59, who was a marketing executive for a major grocery store chain in Charlotte, NC. He had started as a bag boy when he was a freshman in college and eventually worked his way up to the executive suite. When the company was taken over by another food chain a few years ago, he and other executives were given a pat on the back and escorted out the building. He has yet to find another job.\nIn today's workplace environment, you need to be flexible. Just when you reach the pinnacle of your profession, your profession may disappear. At that point, you're probably overqualified to even get another job.\nI have a friend named Jane, age 43, who is a Microsoft Certified Engineer in Memphis. When times got tough for her, she became a certified massage therapist. Now she has a full list of regular clients that keeps her busy. She also designs websites. Her enterprising nature has allowed her to maintain a 100-acre horse ranch.\nI have a friend named Dean, age 68, who once worked for others as a metal polisher. Being the sort of rebellious, vocal employee who always found better ways of doing things, he often found himself at odds with management. So he set up shop in his basement in Minneapolis a couple of decades ago and now fashions antique car parts for rich collectors and distributors. He has so much demand for his unique skill that he turns projects down.\nI have a friend named Patrick, age 62, who once owned a pizza joint in Phoenix. When business turned slow a decade ago, he studied and became a stockbroker, then found a position with a major brokerage house. His wife who had also worked in the pizza joint became a successful real estate agent.\nI have a friend named Stan, age 49, who was once a contract computer programmer in Chicago. He eventually tired of the stress of meeting project goals and the uncertainty of finding another contract, so he worked nights as a janitor in large office buildings. Soon he hired others to do the janitorial work and continually expanded to more and more buildings. Today he has dozens of employees and spends much of his time in the Bahamas.\nThere is a guy in Wyoming named Stanford Addison. At age 20, his truck went out of control as he tried to avoid hitting a herd of horses. After two long years of hospitalization with a spinal cord injury, he became a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Today, some 30 years later, Addison calls himself a \"horse counselor\" as he works with wild mustangs and horses with behavioral problems. Getting in the training pen with a wild horse \"puts you right in there where you have to use all the gifts that the creator blessed you with,\" Addison explains.\nI met a woman named Frankie, age 53, a couple of years ago and we have done a couple of writing projects together. A few years prior to that, she was in a serious motorcycle accident and spent many, many months in a hospital rehabilitating her broken body just to be able to walk once again. She had flourished in the corporate world as an event promoter, but changed directions after the accident. Today, the unstoppable Frankie Picasso is a radio-show host, author, motivational speaker, and professional Certified Life, Business and Master Coach Trainer.\nSome people are helpless without a manager. Some people are hopeless unless they become the manager. Some people want the security of a large organization. Some people want to be self-employed. Some people want to work indoors. Some people want to work outdoors. And some people don't want to work at all. But whatever direction you choose, you need to be prepared to scramble for a cash flow simply to exist in this material world. Food, clothing and shelter are necessary items for self-preservation. And if you are foolish enough to yearn for luxury and bling-bling, you need to scramble that much harder.\nI spent decades as a contract computer programmer myself until my specialty language died. But I'm not too eager to clean buildings so I wrote some novels, a highly unprofitable endeavor so far. I also wrote a weekly newspaper column and taught college computer courses for many years. I finally retired last year.\nIn a world of rapidly advancing technology and global financial instability, the job market is changing faster than a bullet train on steroids. You need to acquire a variety of skills and be prepared to adapt to the changing times.\nLife is simple -- choose a lifestyle that makes you happy, figure out a way to make it work and do it.\nThe world doesn't owe you a job. You owe it to yourself to find the correct path.\n_\nQuote for the Day -- \"If you are going to have dreams, make them big dreams. It takes the same amount of effort and energy for conversion.\" Frankie Picasso (author of Midlife Mojo).\n_\nBret Burquest is an award-winning columnist and author of four novels.

After the moves 1.e4\nc5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.Nc3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Qa5 8.0\u20130\n0\u20130 9.Bb3 d6 10.h3 Bd7 11.f4, I used the\nsolid 11\u2026Nxd4 12.Bxd4 Bc6 13.Qd3 Rad8 in the final years of my career.\nHowever, in earlier times I had a real love for 11\u2026Rac8 when both 12.Qf3\nand 12.Nf3 are met by 12\u2026Qh5. This favorite of the late grandmaster\nLeonid Stein scored well for Black in the mid 60s before some setbacks put\nit on the rubbish heap.\nThough it\u2019s\nnot clear that this \u201cStein Variation\u201d is actually bad\nfor Black, Kapengut wondered if \u2026Rac8 was really necessary,\nand thus he came up with 11\u2026Qh5. Black had the usual ups\nand downs before this, too, was relegated to the \u201ctheoretically\ndubious\u201d pile.\n11\u2026Qh5,\nGOOD OR BAD?\nYears went by and grandmaster\nRoman Dzindzichashvili became interested in\nthe Accelerated Dragon and infused the opening\nwith many new ideas. In particular, he was\nquite high on 11\u2026Qh5 (that\u2019s how\nopenings are: they strike fear into various\nhearts, they get \u201crefuted,\u201d and\nthen they make a comeback), and Gata Kamsky\ndecided to give it a try, too. A brief flurry\nof international activity followed and then,\nonce again, it was laid to rest\u2026before\nbeing raised from the ashes all over again\nby Dzindzi!\nSince retiring from active play, I find myself way out of the theoretical\nloop and so I was trying to milk Donaldson\u2019s brain. \u201cJohn, last\nI heard, 11\u2026Qh5 seemed playable. Has anything new been discovered?\u201d\nAs a response, JD kindly sent the following annotated game.\nBy the way, any readers who have experience in the 11\u2026Nxd4, 11\u2026Rc8\nfollowed by 12\u2026Qh5, or in the 11\u2026Qh5 lines are welcome to share\ntheir games and/or analysis (click HERE to\ncontact me or HERE to\ncontact Donaldson).\nJOHN DONALDSON'S REPLY:\nJeremy, I didn\u2019t\nsee anything convincing for White when we wrote\nour book and I still don\u2019t see anything\nnow!

Six of these 24 skeletons contain genetic signatures that are extremely rare in modern European populations. Based on this discovery, the researchers conclude that early farmers did not leave much of a genetic mark on modern European populations.\n\"This was a surprise. I expected the distribution of mitochondrial DNA in these early farmers to be more similar to the distribution we have today in Europe,\" said Science author Joachim Burger from Johannes Gutenberg Universit\u00e4t Mainz in Mainz, Germany.\n\"Our paper suggests that there is a good possibility that the contribution of early farmers could be close to zero,\" said Science author Peter Forster from the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, UK.\nTo get at questions surrounding the ancestry of modern Europeans, the researchers studied mitochondrial DNA from early farmers in Central Europe. Mothers pass mitochondrial DNA to their offspring primarily \"as is,\" without mixing or recombination with mitochondrial DNA from fathers. Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, provides a way for researchers to piece together how closely members of a species are related, using maternal lineages as a guide, explained Burger.\nIn the new study, the researchers attempted to extract mitochondrial DNA from the skeletons of 56 humans who lived in various parts of Central Europe about 7500 years ago. These ancient humans all belonged to well known cultures that can be identified by the decorations on their pottery -- the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) and the Alf\u00f6ldi Vonaldiszes Ker\u00e1mia (AVK). The presence of these cultures in Central Europe marks the onset of farming in the region. These farming practices originated in the \"Fertile Crescent\" of the Near East about 12,000 years ago.\nFrom bones and teeth of these 56 skeletons, the researchers extracted mitochondrial DNA sufficient for analysis from 24 of the skeletons. Six of the 24 early farmers belonged to the \"N1a\" human lineage, according to genetic signatures or \"haplotypes\" in their mitochondrial DNA that the researchers studied. These six skeletons are from archeological sites all across central Europe. Few modern Europeans belong to this N1a lineage, and those that do are spread across much of Europe.\nThe other 18 early farmers belonged to lineages not useful for investigating the genetic origins of modern Europeans because their genetic signatures from the scrutinized region of mitochondrial DNA are widespread in living humans, according to the authors.\nUsing the tools of population genetics and a worldwide database of 35,000 modern DNA samples, the researchers investigated the genetic legacy of early European farmers based on the fact that six of the 24 early European farmers are from a lineage that is now extremely rare in Europe and around the world.\nAt least 8 percent of the early farmers belonged to the N1a lineage, according to the researchers who estimate the range was between 8 and 42 percent.\nEven this conservative estimate of 8 percent stands in stark contrast to the current percentage of central Europeans who belong to the N1a lineage -- 0.2 percent. This discrepancy suggests that these early farmers did not leave much of a genetic mark on modern Central Europeans, the authors say.\n\"It's interesting that a potentially minor migration of people into Central Europe had such a huge cultural impact,\" said Forster.\nSmall pioneer groups may have carried farming into new areas of Europe, the authors suggest. Once farming had taken hold, the surrounding hunter-gatherers could have adapted the new culture and then outnumbered the original farmers, diluting their N1a frequency to the low modern level. A range of archeological research supports different aspects of this hypothesis, the authors say.\nAlternatively, a different population may have replaced the early farmers in Central Europe, eliminating most of the N1a types, but archaeological evidence for this scenario is scant, according to the authors.\nSource: American Association for the Advancement of Science\nAdd Comment\nMail to a Friend\nLink to this article\nPrint Article\nRelated Bio News & ArticlesBioinformaticsComplete mitochondrial genome of 5,000-year-old mummy yields surpriseOctober 30, 2008 08:17 PMBiologyNeandertal femur suggests competition with hyenas and a shift in landscape useMay\n3, 2005 06:47 PMBiologyOldest cranial, dental and postcranial fossils of early modern European humans confirmedMay 21, 2005 04:52 PM\nComments\nLogin\nUsername\nPassword\nRemember me\nNot yet part of the community?Register Now!\nNext article: Links\nPrevious article: New study shows patients more willing to consider self-injectable HIV therapy than many physicians anticipate\nNovember 19, 2005 11:02 PMBiology\nBiology RSS Feeds\nDisplay our News\nBio News Archive\nBiology Links\nContact Bio News Net\nBookmark Us!

{"id": "clueweb12-0503wb-00-10109", "bracket": "0.6-0.7", "text": "Carl Barks and Theo Faberge Egg, Midnight Egg\nThe Scrooge McDuck Midnight Egg\nby Carl Barks & Theo Faberge\nFirst Figurine\nMAIN MENU\nCharacter images (c) Disney Enterprises, Inc. are provided for infor mation purposes only and not for commercial reuse or reproduction.\nMidnight in the money bin. Uncle Scrooge leans back nd closes his eyes in rapture, dreaming of a frolic in the U.S. Treasury Building. It's after hours, so he has the run of the place. What will he find - ducats? doubloons? an ancient Sumerian crown? Is it possible the government vaults contain more wealth than his own teeming coffers? Billionaires think big, but sometimes the richest fantasies come in small packages. Scrooge's dream of gold and gems has been captured in the form of an egg, a jeweled artwork you can hold in the palm of your hand. Open the shell, slip inside the vault, and you can help McDuck count his treasures.\nOnly one man could have imagined this scene, and only one could have brought it to life using real gems. Carl Barks, who created the fabulously wealthy Scrooge McDuck and drew his comic books for twenty years, is no stranger to gems and treasures. Neither is Theo Faberge, grandson of Carl Faberge, the jeweler who produced ornate Easter gifts for the Russian tsars. Barks was ninety-one and Faberge was seventy and, for the first time, they combined their talents to create a modern artwork in a traditional form.\nOn the outside, the creation is wholly Theo Faberge's. He has imagined the fa\u00e7ade of the Treasury Building as an egg, its dome shining austerely under the night sky, its wings wrapped around to form a shell. Surmounting the dome is the Imperial Russian Crown that can be seen on some of his grandfather's greatest creations.\nIt appears as well on nearly every egg in Theo Faberge's acclaimed St.Petersburg Collection. Inside, the fantasy is by Barks: Scrooge at play in the Treasury, but executed with real treasures by a master jeweler. The fame of Faberge dates from 1870, when Carl Faberge took over his father's business in St. Petersburg. Carl was a shrewd organizer, but it was his flair for creating what he called\nobjects de fantaisie that put the family name on the map. Clocks, cuff links, even his umbrella handles were prized for their beauty and delicate use of enamels. Yet these rich trinkets pale beside the series of jeweled eggs he created for the Romanov tsars. Giving eggs at Easter dates back to the Middle Ages. The gift symbolizes new life at spring and new hope in the Resurrection. Jeweled eggs - often with candy inside - were a favorite with the aristocracy, and Tsar Alexander III wanted a very special present for his Danish tsarina. Carl Faberge created a white enameled egg with a golden yolk - and inside the yolk, a miniature hen of gold. So charmed was the tsar that he commissioned an egg a year after that; and when Nicholas II assumed the throne, he continued the tradition by presenting both his mother and his wife with an egg, each containing a surprise.\nThe fall of the Romanovs left Faberge's son Nicholas stranded in London, where he had traveled to set up an overseas branch. His own son, Theo, founded a fresh business and made it prosper. Today he is a member of Britain's Society of Ornamental Turners and a Freeman of the City of London. And he continues the tradition begun with the Imperial eggs by issuing new creations in limited editions. .\nThe McDuck Midnight Egg is the first in a series of five special commissions from the St. Petersburg Collection that will feature Uncle Scrooge. The shell is crystal, delicate yet durable. Its dome, enameled lapis blue to suggest the midnight sky, is punctuated by seven gold stars representing the decades of Theo Faberge's life. Below, the shell has been etched and hand-painted with 23-karat gold, the purest gold that can be fired onto crystal. Architectural forms evoke the stateliness of the Treasury Building and its egglike, contained quality. A flight of golden stairs leads to a landing flanked by ionic columns bearing up a triangular pediment. The entrance at the foot of the stairs is barred by a golden swag rope, for the Treasury is closed. But between the columns, we catch a glimpse of someone inside. The egg separates in the middle. Lift off the top, and there's Uncle Scrooge luxuriating in a tub of gold coins. His body is silver; indeed, the whole sculpture is sterling silver - 92.5 percent pure. To show this, the rim is stamped with the standard mark of a lion pass ant. It also bears the emblem of Theo Faberge (TF), the mark of the assay office (an anchor denoting Birmingham), and a letter symbolizing the year it was made.\nYou'll need a magnifying glass to see that, and to appreciate the detailing on the figure. Scrooge's coatis enameled in red; his collar, cuffs, and spats are gray. His crown is plated in 24-karat gold, as are his beak, cane, tub, and the coins around him; different colors of gold give each a different luster. His body, textured to resemble feathers, is lacquered to prevent tarnish, while the urn behind him has intentionally been oxidized to a rich green, then protected with lacquer. Surrounding him are two amethysts, two sapphires, and seven rubies - that's counting the stones that adorn the Imperial crown and the Sumerian one. No expense has been spared to make this egg a treasure-house in miniature. And in the tradition of the nicest Easter eggs, there's a second surprise, a treasure within the treasure. Push back the rim of the urn, and you'll find an extra cache of coins, ones the old miser has been saving for a rainy day.\nThe Scrooge McDuck Midnight Egg is made in London and limited worldwide to an edition of 250 individually numbered pieces. Each is etched on the bottom with Theo Faberge's signature and the edition number. Barks' signature, appropriately, is engraved on the base of the silver insert. In addition, the egg comes with a certificate of authenticity signed by both artists. Egg and certificate are housed in a custom carrying case, made especially for the St. Petersburg Collection. Gold fabric and brass fittings outside hint at the riches within, while the lining of white velvet provides an elegant setting for displaying your treasure. Recently the great Love Trophy Egg by Carl Faberge sold at auction for $3.19 million. For considerably less, you can own a piece of the Faberge tradition at a price that Uncle Scrooge himself would approve. His egg will be your nest egg, a treasure of beauty and subtle humor to cherish in the coming years.\nThe Uncle Scrooge Midnight Egg will never again be produced as an Egg and all studio molds have been destroyed or defaced upon completion of this limited edition. This Egg was licensed to The Bruce Hamilton Company by the Walt Disney Company\n", "index": [[153, 177], [295, 308], [690, 697], [877, 883], [1010, 1020], [1057, 1071], [1236, 1242], [1257, 1264], [1272, 1277], [1864, 1869], [1871, 1878], [1894, 1902], [2386, 2393], [2416, 2422], [2441, 2452], [2513, 2525], [2610, 2628], [2667, 2673], [2872, 2883], [3031, 3039], [3059, 3067], [3080, 3086], [3229, 3236], [3352, 3360], [3544, 3557], [4150, 4158], [4296, 4309], [4552, 4554], [4606, 4616], [4757, 4764], [5265, 5273], [5650, 5656], [5813, 5818], [6414, 6427], [6774, 6793]], "wikipedia_ids": [37398, 90742, 90742, 31411, 7345, 29378, 9325, 25391, 7345, 7345, 90742, 53667, 26240, 9325, 18836, 26447, 1592, 76972, 30172853, 26240, 30172853, 17867, 31717, 795137, 90742, 53667, 90742, 205394, 13882056, 90742, 795137, 17867, 7345, 90742, 37398], "wikipedia_titles": ["The Walt Disney Company", "Uncle Scrooge", "Uncle Scrooge", "Clan McDuck", "Carl Barks", "Scrooge McDuck", "Easter", "Russia", "Carl Barks", "Carl Barks", "Uncle Scrooge", "United States Department of the Treasury", "House of Romanov", "Easter", "Middle Ages", "Resurrection", "Alexander III of Russia", "Denmark", "Nicholas II of Russia", "House of Romanov", "Nicholas II of Russia", "London", "United Kingdom", "Imperial (automobile)", "Uncle Scrooge", "United States Department of the Treasury", "Uncle Scrooge", "Task force", "Birmingham", "Uncle Scrooge", "Imperial (automobile)", "London", "Carl Barks", "Uncle Scrooge", "The Walt Disney Company"]}

Once principal is honored from each of the state's 12 districts. A statewide principal of the year winner will be announced at the award celebration.\n\"Obviously I'm very honored,\" Croner said of his upcoming award. \"It's humbling that your colleagues would recommend you for that type of award.\"\nCroner, now in his third year at BHS, has been the driving force behind the transformation of Bellmont High School into an Early College High School, where students simultaneously earn a high school diploma and up to two years of college credit towards a bachelor's degree.\n\"I am a firm believer that although not all change is progress, all progress is the result of change,\" Croner wrote in his nominating petition. \"We as educators are challenged to make significant improvements in our methods of teaching and utilize best practices to improve student achievement. I have worked with the staff at BHS and implemented such practices into our professional learning community. ... We have been named an emerging Early College High School and are on our way to receiving full ECHS status.\"\nThe BHS principal said the shift to an early college high school model, the awarding of physical education credits through athletics and a new credit by examination policy \"are among the things we're doing here at Bellmont of which I'm most proud.\"\nHe was also quick to credit the teaching and support staff at BHS, as well as the North Adams administrative team, for their support of endeavors which he has spearheaded.\n\"All the positive things happening at Bellmont High School are a testament to the excellent staff I have to work with,\" Croner said.\nIn a letter to the IASP in support of Croner's bid for principal of the year honors, North Adams Superintendent of School Wylie Sirk said Croner has \"demonstrated exemplary leadership skills as he facilitates the development, articulation, implementation and stewardship of a clear vision of learning that is shared and supported by stakeholders.\"\nSirk said the BHS principal demonstrates \"fairness, integrity and promotes high ideals ... and encourages understanding and the welfare of students and staff.\"\nBellmont biology teacher Rebecca Dumbaugh called Croner a \"dedicated, inspiring educational leader who has made a tremendous impact on the Bellmont High School/North Adams school district in his short time here.\"\nCroner is a graduate of North Manchester High School, where he was a member of the varsity basketball team. He played college basketball at Manchester College while earning his bachelor's degree in mathematics. Croner earned his master's degree in educational administration from Purdue University in 2005, and is working toward his Ph.D. in educational leadership, also at Purdue.\nAfter starting his teaching career as a math teacher with the Lafayette School Corporation, Croner spent two years as the dean of students at Fairfield Community Schools in Goshen before taking a vice principal's job at Delta High School in Delaware County. He was hired in the summer of 2008 as the BHS principal.\nCopyright 2010 Decatur Daily Democrat\nDecatur, IN\nStaff Writer\nDecatur Daily Democrat\n513fe8b5cc17799e1aad\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 The Decatur Daily Democrat | 141 S.

Files saved with the help of Xvid can be played with MPlayer, VLC, ffdshow or Perian. Oftentimes users prefer to convert Xvid to MPEG4 files because the latter is more popular than the former.\nThe easiest way to do so is download or use online xvid mpeg4 converter. The downside of such applications, however, is their limited functionality and low quality. The good thing about them is low price and popularity.\nSomehow, if you are the one who values high quality and functionality, you should consider downloading all-purpose video converter. Try downloading Total Movie Converter by CoolUtils to see what real quality is about. Unlike mpeg4 video converter, CoolUtils movie converter is suitable for processing of dozens of video formats.

They are as follows:\nAffordability. There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive software. Total Movie Converter is offered by CoolUtils for less than $30.

The ISE's benchmark stock index rallied significantly in 2009 after suffering a major downturn in 2008 following the global financial crisis, and began trading a new joint index for Turkish and Greek equities.\nBackground\nThe ISE was launched in 1985 and began trading securities publicly in 1986. In 1987, the exchange commenced publishing its benchmark stock index, the ISE-100 (also called the IMKB-100) on a daily instead of weekly basis, and in 1994 the ISE switched to fully-automated electronic trading. Six years later following a wave of global stock market demutualizations, the ISE took a 27.4 percent stake in the Baku Stock Exchange in Azerbaijan and a 5.26 percent stake in the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange in Kyrgyzstan.[1]\nFollowing several years of strong market growth, the ISE was slammed in 2008 by the global financial crisis and saw its total market capitalization fall by more than half from US$288 billion at the end of 2007 to just US$118 billion one year later. Over the same period, the benchmark ISE-100 index also dropped by more than half, from 55,538 points in 2007 to 26,864 in 2008.[2] By the end of 2008, 317 listed Tukish companies and nine Turkish exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were listed on the ISE.\nIn mid-October 2009 the ISE and its Greek counterpart, the Athens Stock Exchange (Athex), officially launched the Greece-Turkey 30 Index (GT-30) as a benchmark index for their markets combined.[3] The GT-30 is a STOXX customized index consisting of the 15 companies with the highest market capitalization on each exchange, calculated in Turkish lira and euros.[4] Its development and launch was the result of long-term co-operation between the two exchanges, which had received applications to develop exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on the GT-30.\nBy mid-December 2009 the ISE had recovered some of its losses from the previous year, with the ISE-100 standing at just over 31,600, a gain of 17.2 percent on the year and a 22 percent rise since April.[5] The index crossed the 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a year.\nIn November 2011, plans were announced for a merger between Turkey's two largest exchanges, ISE and TurkDEX. CEO Huseyin Erkan also announced at that time that he would step down due to a new law passed by the Turkish government, giving the capital city of Ankara the power to appoint executives to the ISE board.[6]\nKey people\nISE Chairman and CEO Huseyin Erkan first joined the ISE in 1994 and was appointed executive vice-chairman in 1996, a position he held for 10 years.[7] He was appointed chairman and CEO in November 2007 and one year later was elected to the board of directors of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE). Erkan is also president of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS), a group he helped launch. He graduated New York University's Stern School of Business with an MBA in International Business and Finance in 1984.\nReferences\n\u2191 Milestones in ISE history.

Does it go the way of football and allow the moneyed clubs to procure all the best and brightest young talent, thus making any battle for trophies a three or four-horse race? Does it want to lose its long and proud tradition whereby any of the 18 counties can realistically win the Championship? In short, does our summer game want to fully embrace capitalism and all the free-market obligations that that entails?\nI think most fans of the county game would answer no to those questions. We want to retain the competitiveness that has given us gripping climaxes to last two county seasons. And we want to be charmed by the heart-warming stories of cash-strapped clubs being led to title glory by long-serving and loyal legends of the game. So what is the solution?\nWinston Churchill once said that capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. In the case of cricket clubs those blessings are the likes of the Taylors, the Denlys, and, who knows, in the future, the Shiv Thakors and the Reece Topleys.\nIn a normal profession those players would naturally gravitate towards the best paid jobs and leave their educators, usually the state, behind. They would then, of course, reward those educators for their efforts in the form of taxes and that money would then be used to train the next generation \u2013 and so the cycle continues.\nIn cricket, unlike even in premiership football - that Mecca to capitalism - this doesn\u2019t happen. The likes of Leicestershire or Kent do not currently receive any of football\u2019s compensation or solidarity payments when they lose their best and brightest young talent to the Manchester Uniteds of cricket, meaning that they suffer a gradual depletion of their resources which causes the problems to escalate.\nUntil recently, this lack of reward didn\u2019t matter as players were reluctant to move clubs and the financial rewards for staging international cricket \u2013 the single most important factor in making some clubs so rich - were not so high.\nThat has all changed over the past decade or so, with the likes of Test match endowed Surrey now able to spend three times as much as the likes of Test matchless Kent on player salaries. This means that, as well as producing their own players, Surrey are able to poach the best young talent from the smaller counties without paying any form of compensation for the training and nurturing that the player has received through that county\u2019s Academy system.\nNumerous moves have been suggested over the past few years, including salary caps and the like, but nothing has really changed the view that county cricket is sleepwalking into a two-tier oblivion.\nPerhaps the only answer is to adopt a transfer system similar to that used in football \u2013 only to perhaps go further \u2013 so that the smaller counties can be compensated for their losses. After all, the principle aim of counties \u2013 unlike for premiership football teams - is not to win trophies but to produce England players, so why should Leicestershire et al be penalised financially for doing just that?\nDaniel Grummitt\n\u00a9 Cricket World 2011\nOpen an account with\u00a0bet365 today and qualify for up to \u00a3200 in free bets with our fantastic 100% Deposit Bonus.\nCounty CricketCounty Cricketers Abroad Part III\nWith many of England's county cricketers now heading home from their off-season destinations in time for Christmas, we take our monthly look at how they have been performing for their franchises or states so far in the 2011-12 season.\nPietersen To Stay With Surrey Indefinitely\nEngland batsman Kevin Pietersen has extended his contract with Surrey until the end of his international career.\nPietersen, who first signed for the club on a one-year deal in 2011 following a loan spell in 2010, will play for the Brown Caps until he no longer has an ECB Central Contract.\nWoakes Extends Bears Contract\nWarwickshire and England seam-bowler Chris Woakes has signed a new two-year deal with the county which will see him remain with the club until at least the end of the 2014 season.\nBen Harmison Signs Kent Deal\nKent have signed former Durham all-rounder Ben Harmsion on a contract of undisclosed length ahead of the 2012 season.\nTomlinson And Rossington Extend County Contracts\nMiddlesex wicket-keeper Adam Rossington and Hampshire seam bowler James Tomlinson have both signed contract extensions with their respective counties.\nRossington, an 18 year-old who has represented England\u2019s Under-19 side, has extended his existing contract by one year to the end of 2013, while Tomlinson has also signed until the end of the 2013 season.\nPhilander Signs For Somerset\nSomerset have tentatively announced that they have secured the services of South African all-rounder Vernon Philander as their overseas player for the first two months of the 2012 season.

Acer on Wednesday in a statement\nsaid that it has no plans to phase out netbooks as it increases its focus on tablets.\nThe company also said that it does not foresee tablets based on Sandy Bridge processors,\ncontrary to comments made earlier this week by an Acer sales manager in Taiwan.\nLu Bing-hsian earlier this week told the IDG News Service that Acer would begin\nselling new tablet PCs in the first half of this year as it gradually phases out\nnetbooks and that tablets would come with processors based on Intel's Sandy Bridge\nmicroarchitecture. \"For the moment it is not foreseen yet ... devices based\non Sandy Bridge,\" Acer said. Acer said the range of devices available to\nusers is expanding and that tablets \"will find their space next to netbooks\nand notebooks, without taking over.\" Acer in November announced new tablets\nwith 5-inch, 7-inch and 10-inch screens running on Google's Android operating system, which were also shown at the recent Consumer Electronics Show. The company\nalso showed a tablet with a 10-inch screen running Windows 7\n", "index": [[786, 793], [976, 978], [2593, 2596], [2606, 2610], [2638, 2646], [2740, 2742], [2744, 2747], [2749, 2758], [2763, 2772], [2785, 2796], [2798, 2804], [2809, 2819], [2821, 2825], [2870, 2874], [3053, 3065], [3128, 3132], [3150, 3156], [3199, 3215], [3221, 3225], [3381, 3386], [3389, 3401], [3481, 3493], [3496, 3500], [3507, 3511], [3664, 3668], [3754, 3760], [3763, 3787], [3825, 3850], [3915, 3924]], "wikipedia_ids": [52742, 18998720, 15292, 216454, 378213, 21347024, 40379651, 220355, 19006979, 13481318, 8841749, 13111239, 397169, 397169, 7190463, 397169, 25734, 846558, 397169, 14617, 7190463, 7190463, 397169, 397169, 397169, 1092923, 12610483, 273555, 326123], "wikipedia_titles": ["Desktop computer", "BP", "Ink", "IPAQ", "Scanners", "Hewlett-Packard", "IBM", "Vaio", "Mac (computer)", "Palm Centro", "IPhone", "IPod Touch", "Acer Inc.", "Acer Inc.", "Sandy Bridge", "Acer Inc.", "Taiwan", "International Data Group", "Acer Inc.", "Intel", "Sandy Bridge", "Sandy Bridge", "Acer Inc.", "Acer Inc.", "Acer Inc.", "Google", "Android (operating system)", "Consumer Electronics Show", "Windows 7"]}

Time to move on. Oh sure, Bama was playing at the time. Its\nfirst game in the SEC Tournament. A pivotal, super-important second-round matchup with\nGeorgia. In the eyes of many, this was an NCAA Tournament play-out game\nfor the loser, especially if that loser was Bama. And with seven minutes\nleft in the second half, Bama trailed by 14. As in 1-4. As in two\ntouchdowns. As in not coming back. As in this game's over. In fact, it\nlooked like the beating was going to get worse. This was Gainesville,\nPart II. This was another egg-laying performance by the Tide in another\nhigh-stakes, big stage setting.\nHmmm. AJ or Phillip. Wonder how\ngood Aaron Douglas is going to look at left tackle. Heard A-Day is going\nto be on ESPNU this spring.\nThen JaMychal Green hit a pair of free throws. Trey Thompkins hit one for Georgia. Thirteen-point lead.\nWonder why Nick Saban always wears a suit on A-Day. Wonder if he's calling a high school coach right about now regarding a recruit.\nCharvez\nDavis jumper off the glass. An inside bucket by Green. Another bucket\nby Green. Hey, it's a seven-point game now with 3:37 to play. Is it\npossible that ... I mean could Bama really ... Or is this just a big\ntease. If nothing else, at least Bama is making it respectable, right? A\nTrevor Releford free throw. A Davis layup. Are you kidding? A\nfour-point game with three minutes to play.\nIt looked like Georgia\nhad awoken just in time when Thompkins converted a three-point play\nwith 2:49 to play to push the lead back to seven, but Bama answered\nright back with a Davis trey to cut it to four again. This Tide team\nwasn't going to go away. Spring football? Uh ... maybe that talk can wait. Bama\ntrailed by two when Releford showed some late-game moxie by driving\nthrough heavy traffic in the lane and scooping a tying basket off the\nglass with a mere 4.2 seconds to play.\nIt looked for a brief\nsecond like Georgia had pulled off the great escape when Dustin Ware threw up a desperation, long-range 3-pointer with under a second to play, and it went in. But Georgia coach\nMark Fox had called timeout and was granted that timeout prior to Ware\nreleasing the shot. With .8 seconds to play, Thompkins heaved up an\nairball.\nOvertime. Bama, which had NIT written all over it just a few minutes earlier, had new life.\nIn\novertime, the Tide continued to hang close. Finally, with 2:44 left,\nChris Hines scored to give Bama a 59-58 advantage. The Tide's first lead\nsince being up 9-8 early in the game. Yeah, it had been that long. A\nWare free-throw knotted it back up at 59-59. Then, with 1:32 showing on\nthe clock, Tony Mitchell seized the moment by stepping up and knocking\ndown a huge 3-pointer.\nIt proved to be the game-winner. It also may prove to be the shot\nthat saved Bama's NCAA Tournament hopes. The Tide went on to win\nSaturday, 65-59, and talk now is that that victory -- the Tide's fifth\nthis season over a foe from the big, bad SEC Eastern Division -- just\nmay have catapulted Bama, now 21-10, into the Big Dance. ESPN's bracket\nguru Joe Lunardi is now projecting Bama as one of the last four teams in\nand Georgia, 21-11, as one of the last four teams out.\nWhatever it did as far as Bama's NCAA Tourney hopes it certainly\nmade Anthony Grant's squad look good. Two more wins and Bama won't need a\nselection committee to decide its fate. The Tide moves on now to the\nSEC Tournament semifinals -- its deepest run in the tourney since '05 --\nand will take on Kentucky at noon CT Saturday. The finals are set for noon\nSunday with the NCAA Tournament field scheduled to be announced later Sunday.\nAnd\nspeaking of fate, don't tell Grant there's no such thing. When asked\nafter the game about how the game played out in Bama's favor late in\nregulation and then in overtime, he replied, \"It's fate, I guess.\"\nBut this Tide team, characterized by its tenacity, will and fight throughout the second half of the season, did its part, too.\n\"We\nstayed the course,\" Grant said, referencing the amazing comeback. \"Our\nenergy on the defensive end the last seven minutes of the game was what\nwon the game for us.\"\nBama got in the hole -- the one it spent\nmost of the game in -- late in the first half when Georgia hit\nback-to-back-to-back 3-pointers to turn a 19-19 contest into a 28-19\nadvantage. The Bulldogs remained comfortably ahead -- never letting its\nlead dip below six points -- until that game-changing 11-1 run Green\nstarted the Tide on when he hit those two free throws at the 6:43 mark.\nGreen finished with a team-high 20 points, while Travis Leslie's 24 points paced Georgia.\nLatest Blog Entries\nCharacter?

{"id": "clueweb12-0501wb-31-17194", "bracket": "0.5-0.6", "text": "MAA - Spring 2008 - Donald H. Gilden, '63\nOn the Heels of MS\nDonald H. Gilden, \u201963, knew the moment he touched the dying man\u2019s cold hand he wanted to become a doctor. He was just five years old when he made his decision. His grandfather had taken him to visit a friend who was dying of congestive heart failure and was surviving in an oxygen tent. Young Gilden was under strict orders not to disturb the man, but he disobeyed his grandfather slipping his hand under the tent. The old man squeezed the boy\u2019s fingers and told him stories about his grandfather.\n\u201cAfter that day I never stopped talking about it,\u201d says Gilden, professor and chairman of the department of neurology and professor of microbiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \u201cI was going to be a doctor when I grew up. I never wanted to do anything else.\u201d\nGilden, age 70, has indeed made his mark on the profession. He is recognized as a pioneer in the field of neurovirology for groundbreaking work relating to shingles and multiple sclerosis (MS).\nAfter nearly 150 years of medical speculation, Gilden discovered that varicella zoster virus\u2014the virus that causes shingles\u2014is latent in human ganglia. More than a million people a year suffer from shingles, and his work helped lead to a shingles vaccination.\nHe has also been working to track down the virus he believes causes MS, a disease that affects about a quarter of a million people in the United States. But this has been far more challenging. Yet Gilden is focused on what he wants to accomplish and understands that it will perhaps take the rest of his life, or even longer, to reach answers. \u201cYou have to be patient,\u201d he says. \u201cScience goes little by little. Progress is little by little.\u201d\nFor his work, Gilden has received an alumni award for distinguished service from the University of Chicago School of Medicine, the International Society for NeuroVirology Pioneer Award, and, in May, he will receive the Medical Alumni Association\u2019s Honor Award and Gold Key, presented for outstanding medical accomplishments and distinguished service to mankind.\nA neurologist by training, Gilden sees patients who suffer from migraines, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s, stroke, and Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cI will see anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cClinical neurology has always been one of my first loves.\u201d But most of his time is spent in the lab conducting research in the microscopic world of DNA, RNA, viruses, and proteins. \u201cSometimes in the lab my head is spinning because we have big things going on,\u201d Gilden says.\nAs a boy growing up in Baltimore, Gilden\u2019s world revolved around school and working summers in the family business, Sam Gilden & Son, a wholesale store that supplied hair tonic, razor blades, bobby pins, toothpaste, and other items to local drug stores. He unloaded trucks, packed orders, swept floors, and, when he was old enough, made deliveries in a bright red Dodge delivery truck His father saw him taking over the business one day, a task which demanded hard work and long hours. \u201cWe never had dinner with my father,\u201d Gilden recalls. \u201cThe wholesale business was a tough business.\u201d\nGilden\u2019s real \u201cjob\u201d was to go to school, and he excelled in biology, chemistry, and math. Classes in foreign language, however, barely held his interest. \u201cFor me the language of medicine was all I ever cared about,\u201d he says.\nHe graduated from Dartmouth College in 1959, and moved back home to go to medical school. Gilden interned at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago, and did his residency in neurology at the University of Chicago Hospitals.\nIt was in the late 1960s while he was a staff neurologist in the US Army at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, that he became interested in research. After seeing patients during the day, he had time to catch his breath in the evening and mull over the amazing research underway. Researchers had discovered that measles virus in the brain could cause chronic encephalitis, and that Jakob-Creutzfeld disease\u2014a \u201cdegenerative\u201d brain disorder in humans\u2014was infectious.\n\u201cI said to my wife, \u2018I think I want to do a fellowship in infectious diseases,\u2019\u201d recalls Gilden, who was 32 at the time. \u201cShe looked at me like she married a crazy man.\u201d\nHe was accepted at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health as a postdoctoral National Institutes of Health fellow. After about three years, he joined the faculty at University of Pennsylvania and set up a lab at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia to find the virus that causes MS.\nHe worked closely with MS patients who lived in a chronic care facility and were ravaged by the disease. Gilden asked if they would donate their brains after death to his research because he was looking for the cause of MS. Sometimes his phone rang in the middle of the night and within an hour Gilden was harvesting brain from their skulls. \u201cI had my own saw,\u201d he says.\nHe studied 24 brains over eight years, but never found the MS virus. So, he turned his attention to varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox in children and shingles in adults. Nobody had ever isolated the virus, and if he could prove it was there he believed he could use the same technique to find the MS virus.\nHe tore into his work mapping the viral genome in human ganglia along the entire nervous system. In 1983, he proved for the first time that the virus was latent in ganglia and \u201creawakens\u201d causing shingles. The shingles virus causes pain and even stroke if it makes its way to the brain.\nGilden found several other diseases caused by the virus, such as zoster sine herpete, or shingles without the rash. His discoveries led to more work for his team.\nGilden left the University of Pennsylvania in 1985 to become professor and chairman of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and professor of microbiology.\nAt the University of Colorado, 15 members of Gilden\u2019s team are working on varicella zoster virus and MS. They harvest ganglia collected from an autopsy room. \u201cWe go there every day,\u201d Gilden says. \u201cIf it is a good case we will go as far as we have to. We even get specimens from Japan.\u201d\nMS has been a hard case to crack, but Gilden seems to be making progress. The common theory is that MS is autoimmune. The body\u2019s immune response attacks a protein that is normally in the brain. The attack is so violent and persistent that the brain is destroyed in the process.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that is the case at all,\u201d Gilden says. \u201cEven now we have evidence that it is not autoimmune.\u201d He argues that in people with MS who have increased amounts of an antibody called immunoglobulin G (IgG), in their brain and spinal fluid, the IgG is directed against an infectious agent, but nobody is quite sure at what agent it is directed.\nHe and his team are looking for footprints of virus in MS. \u201cWe are writing a paper showing that the immune response in MS is not against a self (auto) protein,\u201d he says.\nWhile he is busy with his research, Gilden, who is married and has three adult sons, skis and plays the violin\u2014a 1779 Guadagnini. He is also quick to tell\na joke.\nGilden would like to find out what causes MS and how to prevent varicella zoster virus from reactivating. He is unfazed by the fact that his research into MS\n", "index": [[1027, 1029], [1360, 1362], [1430, 1443], [1672, 1679], [1819, 1859], [2191, 2200], [2216, 2225], [2413, 2416], [2557, 2566], [2898, 2903], [3364, 3381], [3494, 3501], [3545, 3576], [3643, 3650], [3654, 3685], [3689, 3703], [4331, 4360], [4419, 4445], [4490, 4502], [4533, 4535], [4560, 4562], [4757, 4759], [4967, 4969], [5219, 5221], [5695, 5721], [5975, 5977], [6152, 6157], [6160, 6162], [6260, 6262], [6578, 6580], [6648, 6651], [6691, 6694], [6846, 6848], [6910, 6912], [7166, 7168], [7279, 7281]], "wikipedia_ids": [50603, 50603, 3434750, 26700, 4099669, 18914017, 22228064, 25758, 26997138, 42969, 8418, 6886, 5374478, 32087, 791464, 108956, 46174, 31793, 50585, 50603, 50603, 50603, 50603, 50603, 31793, 50603, 15573, 50603, 50603, 50603, 490666, 490666, 50603, 50603, 50603, 50603], "wikipedia_titles": ["Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "United States", "Science", "Pritzker School of Medicine", "Alzheimer's disease", "Parkinson's disease", "RNA", "Baltimore", "Dodge", "Dartmouth College", "Chicago", "University of Chicago Medical Center", "United States Army", "Walter Reed Army Medical Center", "Washington, D.C.", "National Institutes of Health", "University of Pennsylvania", "Philadelphia", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "University of Pennsylvania", "Multiple sclerosis", "Japan", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulin G", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Multiple sclerosis"]}

likely to have substantial errors and will not match perfectly.\nView Complete Notes on Fielding Data\nLeagues historically made no effort to balance team, league, and player fielding stats.\nSince 1990 or so, computers have made this feasible, but prior to that there are hundreds or thousands of discrepancies each year in games played (even whether a player played a position), putouts, assists, double plays and errors.\nPre-1950 SB & CS data for catchers is estimated from catcher assists, games started and opposition stolen bases.\nFrom 1950 on SB, CS, Pickoff, & WP data for catchers and pitchers is taken from play-by-play accounts in the retrosheet files.\nThere are several hundred games without pbp from 1950 to 1973 and for those we may not have any data.\nCG & GS come from the retrosheet data and should be complete and pretty accurate from 1919 on.\nInnings played (like SB and CS) come from the retrosheet play-by-play data and should be considered mostly complete from 1950 to 1973 and complete from then on.\nStats (PO,A,G, etc) for LF-CF-RF positions\n(since 1919) is taken from play-by-play or box score data as available.\nStats (PO,A,G,etc) for C,P,1B,2B,3B,SS,OF positions is taken from the official reported totals and may have been corrected at various times since their publication.\nFor detailed information on which games retrosheet is missing play-by-play from 1950 to 1973, please see their most wanted games list\nFor detailed information on the availability of data on this site by year, see our data coverage page\nAppearances on Leader Boards, Awards,

The results show that appropriate\nirradiation intensity can prominently decrease die pressure and apparent\nviscosity, increase output, reduce extrudate swell, and improve apparent\nquality of PP. DSC and WAX analysis demonstrate that the crystalline structure\nof PP is changed and the content of the beta crystalline increases through\nultrasonic vibration. Special effects can be induced by ultrasound, such\nas strong stress, shatter and vibration, which alter the growth of PP\ncrystals and may favor a special crystal transformation (alpha -> beta).\nINTRODUCTION\nRecently, some new processing\ntechniques have been emerging, such as the direct application of physical\n(mechanical) fields on polymer melts. The route can be realized by introducing\nmechanical or ultrasonic vibrations. Compared with low-intensity vibration,\nultrasonic waves are widely employed to influence a medium through shatter,\ncavitation, chemical and mechanical action, with low noise. Lemelson (1)\ndescribed an apparatus and method for controlling the internal structure\nof plastics in a mold. By applying ultrasonic energy to the solidifying\nmaterial, the apparatus can control well the crystalline structure formed\nduring solidification. Pendleton (2) also described an ultrasonic process\nto modify the crystalline structure of blown polyolefin films. Khamad\n(3) reported that imposition of ultrasound on HDPE melts containing a\nsmall amount of butyl rubber resulted in increase of cystallinity, reduction\nof structural defects, and enhancement of mechanical properties. Isayev\nand Levin (4-7) introduced ultrasonic vibrations to an extruder by which\nthey accomplished reclaiming rubber from old tires and found improvements\nof some mechanical properties of the extrudate, such as strain at break\nand Young's modulus. However, there is little study on crystalline structure\nof PP for the case when ultrasound is employed at the die entrance.\nThis article studies PP extrusion\nwith parallel superposition of ultrasonic waves upon the die. The effects\nof ultrasound vibrations during extrusion on improving processability\nand crystallization of PP melts are described. EXPERIMENTAL\nMaterials and Experimental Setup\nPP, 2401, with a melt index of\n2.5 g/10 min and a density of 0.905 g/cm^sup 3^ at 25 deg C, was commercially\nobtained from Yanshan Petrochemical Co., Beijing, China.\nThe Ultrasound-Extrusion experimental\nsetup consists of a single- screw extruder (d = 20 mm, L/D = 25), with\na variable cross-section capillary having high-temperature pressure transducer\nand ultrasonic generator (Fig. 1). The ultrasonic frequency is 20 kHz\nand power ranges from 0 to 300W. The direction of ultrasonic vibration\ncoincides with that of the melt flow. Samples used for all tests were\ndirectly from extruded strands, which are short and very near to the die.\nDifferent samples were extruded one by one at the same rotation speed,\ndie temperature (200 deg C) and different ultrasonic intensity. They were\nthen all cooled at the same room temperature.\nMFI\nThe melt flow index of samples\nwas measured on an American CS- 127 Melt Flow Index measuring device at\n230 deg C with a load of 2160 g.\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nDie Temperature\nFigure 2 shows a prominently exponential\nascendance in die temperature by introducing ultrasonic vibration during\nextrusion of PP. In presence of 250 W ultrasonic intensity, die temperature\nat 5 rpm jumped 10 deg C higher than without ultrasonic vibration. This\nis because part of the sound energy is converted into heat energy by the\ninternal friction between the melt molecules. For a given shear rate,\nthe temperature rise is a function of ultrasonic intensity. The higher\nthe intensity, the more violent the molecular motion, and the greater\nthe temperature rise.\nDie Pressure and Throughput\nThe dependence of die pressure\non ultrasonic intensity at different screw speed was examined. Figure\n3 shows that higher ultrasonic intensity and lower rotation speed both\ncontribute to a larger reduction of pressure, indicating that the pressure\ndrop depends on the intensity and duration of ultrasonic treatment. An\nincrease of both factors gives the melt the chance to obtain stronger\nenergy from ultrasound. In addition, ultrasonic vibration during extrusion\naffects the throughput of extrudate; the flow rate increases with an increase\nin the ultrasonic wave intensity, as shown in Fig. 4. All of the above-mentioned\ncharacteristics demonstrate that ultrasonic treatment will significantly\nimprove the extrusion efficiency.\nApparent Viscosity\nThe prominent pressure drops after\nthe introduction of ultrasound into melts are surely related to molecular\nchain structure, which can be reflected in viscosity data. Figure 5 shows\nthe dependence of apparent viscosity on ultrasonic intensity at various\nrotation speeds. Ultrasonic motions result in a sharp decrease of viscosity\nof the melt. Since higher screw speed means shorter residence time, the\ndecrease of apparent viscosity of PP is also a function of ultrasonic\nintensity and time, just like the pressure reduction. Further, Fig. 6\ndemonstrate that MFR increases after application of ultrasound under the\nsame extrusion conditions. But with low- intensity ultrasound, MFR changes\nvery little-from 4.2 g/10 min (OW) to 4.7 g/ 10 min (100 W). It may be\nconcluded that appropriate ultrasonic irradiation can accelerate molecular\nmotion and make long entangled macromolecular chains unravel with a low\ndegree of degradation.\nDie Swell\nThe swelling of the extrudate\nin capillary extrusion is a manifestation of the elastic properties and\nthe fading memory of the melt, and is a result of unrelaxed deformations\ngenerated during the extrusion process. Figure 7 shows that die swell\nratios D/D^sub 0^ decrease with increasing ultrasonic irradiation power.\nSince swelling is a relaxation process, energy from ultrasonic irradiation\ncan affect the relaxation of polymer melts by shortening the relaxation\ntime of chain segments, thus decreasing the elasticity of the melt at\nthe die entrance. It is also observed that ultrasonic waves contribute\nto a smoother appearance of extrudates.\nCrystalline Structure\nUltrasound can greatly improve\nthe processing of PP, and this effect must be a result of structural changes\nof the PP chain. At the same time, PP is well known for its different\ncrystalline forms: alpha, beta and gamma forms. So the ultrasonic irradiation\nprobably induces the change of the crystal structure. To verify this hypothesis,\nsamples were analyzed by DSC and WAXD. Table 1 summarizes the values obtained\nfrom DSC thermograms. T^sub c^ is the crystallization temperature, T^sub\nonset^ is the temperature at the cross point of the megathermic tangent\nline and the base line at angle of alpha. Si, the tangent of alpha, is\na measure of the rate of nucleation. (T^sub onset^-T^sub c^) is a measure\nof overall rate of crystallization of the system, which decreases with\nthe increase of the crystallization rate (11). It has been found that\nwith the use of ultrasonic vibration, (T^sub onset^-- T^sub c^), Si and\ncrystallinity are lower than their respective values for a sample without\nultrasonic treatment. This indicates that ultrasound prevents nucleation\nas well as accelerating the growth of PP crystal, and the decreased rate\nof nucleation may lead to lower crystallinity. Furthermore, it is also\nnoted from Fig. 8 that in the case of ultrasound, the peak occurring at\nlower temperature, which corresponds to fusion of beta-form (temperature\nof the peak is about 145 deg C), becomes stronger and the enthalpy is\nhigher. The other hightemperature peak due to fusion of the alpha-form\nis correspondingly weaker. These investigations may imply that processing\nPP with ultrasound causes a preference for the growth of the beta-form\nrelative to that of the alpha-form.\nTable 1.\nIt can be seen from the X-ray\ndiffraction patterns that PP samples with and without ultrasonic treatment\nare different (Fig. 9 and Table 2). By introducing ultrasonic effects,\npeaks at theta = 16 deg, 21.3 deg increase and become markedly wider (Mg.\n9). In addition, Table 2 shows the values of the increase of K. According\nto Turner-Jones (9), these indicate an increase of the beta-forms of polypropylene.\nMoreover, the data listed in Table 2 show that nearly all the d spacing\nof crystal planes of PP decrease and values of S increase with ultrasonic\ntreatment. The maximum contribution (K = 29.5%) and maximum order (S =\n47.9%) of the beta phase are in the samples affected by ultrasonic power\nof 180 W. All the above imply that ultrasonic vibrations can shorten the\ndistances between molecular chains and decrease the crystal defects and\ndisordered structure, so that the lattices of PP have an increased order.\nThe enhancement of the beta-form combined with the decrease of crystallinity\nimplies that the polymorphic transitions alpha -> beta of PP may exist\nin the system.\nCONCLUSION\nThe application of ultrasound\nto extrusion can improve the processing of PP by raising the die temperature\nand decreasing pressure and viscosity, thus enhancing the throughput and\nappearance of extrudate\\s.\nThe results show that this ultrasonic\nprocess can modify the structure of crystallizable thermoplastic materials\nlike PP during extrusion. Ultrasonic irradiation results in a reduction\nof the crystallinity of extruded PP. Ultrasound also shows a selective\neffect on the growth of different crystal forms of PP, which causes an\nincrease of the relative amount and order of the beta-form as well as\ntransitions of the alpha-form to the beta-form.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis paper is based on results\nfrom the subject supported by the Special Funds for Major State Basic\nResearch Projects (G1999064809).\nTable 2.\nREFERENCE\n1.

The Taxpayers deserve it! \u00a0Why do we need to get Obama out of the White House? The Taxpayers deserve it! \u00a0Why do we spend $10 million investigating Clinton's use of his privates? \u00a0The Taxpayers deserve it! \u00a0Why should we deny marriage equality? \u00a0The Taxpayers deserve it!\nAnd it goes for both sides of the aisle. \u00a0Seemingly rational Democratic legislators start saying we need to protect Social Security because the Taxpayers deserve it! \u00a0End the Iraq War why? \u00a0The Taxpayers deserve it! \u00a0Eliminate bargaining for public sector unions? The Taxpayers deserve it! (Yeah, I'm looking at you Sweeney. \u00a0And your well-funded 2013 primary from a union member who understands how important bargaining is.)\nBut there is a massive flaw that makes the use of \"Taxpayers\" even more moronic than \"real Americans.\" \u00a0At least \"real Americans\" implies there are \"unreal Americans\" out there to fight.\nBut anyone who buys a tire for a car, a gallon of gasoline, takes a paycheck from an honest employer, rides an airplane, buys a house, buys a book, goes to the movies, or engages in any other of a billion different actions and transactions is an American Taxpayer.\nIn fact, you don't even have to set foot in the United States to be a taxpayer. \u00a0A Saudi Arabian can own 100% of a company operating the United States, meaning they pay taxes here. \u00a0A French citizen who never left Paris could export wine, and is now an American Taxpayer. \u00a0That Mexican coyote sneaking illegal aliens into the United States and gets a hotel room for the people he pays to treat them like shit is an American Taxpayer.\nAnd you know who else is an American Taxpayer? \u00a0The school teacher Chris Christie demonized the other day as screwing over American Taxpayers. \u00a0The state union worker who Steve Sweeney just demonized as sucking at the teat of American Taxpayers! \u00a0All of these people who the right and \"left\" have demonized as screwing over the American Taxpayers are American Taxpayers!\nBut I'll take it one more step, and the saddest thing about what I am about to lay out for you is that it is not taking my argument to the illogical extreme. \u00a0It is not reductio ad absurdum. \u00a0It is simply a plain hard fact -- something sorely missing in our public and political discourse today -- that the following people were not only American Taxpayers but also New Jersey Taxpayers:\nAbd al-Aziz al-UmariAhmed al-Ghamdi \u00a0 Salim al-Hazmi \u00a0 Nawaf al-Hazmi \u00a0 Majid Muqid \u00a0 Khalid al-Mihdhar \u00a0 Hani Hanjur\nThese seven men at one time or another paid New Jersey and United States sales and income taxes, gasoline taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, and any number or other fees or taxes.\nAnd on September 11th these seven men boarded airplanes and flew them the fuck into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and thanks to some courageous passengers an empty field in Pennsylvania.\nSo the next time some moronic politician wants to tell you that we are doing something for the taxpayers, don't let them use that rhetoric to shut you down. \u00a0Just remind them that everyone is a taxpayer, even those who hate this country, and you don't want to justify political actions in a way that supports the terrorists of 9/11.\nWe need to go back to talking about American Citizens, about citizenship, about engaging in public life as an American. \u00a0These are things that Americans and immigrants can aspire to and desire. \u00a0It is hard to be a good citizen. \u00a0It takes work to be a citizen. \u00a0You have to sacrifice to be a citizen. \u00a0You have to give up evenings with your children to be a citizen. \u00a0You have to waste vacation days at work to be a citizen.\nAll you have to do to be a taxpayer is buy a Snickers\n", "index": [[457, 465], [811, 819], [953, 970], [1066, 1074], [1088, 1096], [1379, 1388], [1500, 1509], [1680, 1689], [1765, 1774], [1810, 1815], [1827, 1838], [1844, 1853], [1909, 1916], [1945, 1954], [2011, 2020], [2094, 2104], [2149, 2164], [2177, 2186], [2208, 2216], [2227, 2236], [2301, 2310], [2550, 2559], [2578, 2587], [2615, 2624], [2959, 2972], [2994, 3007], [3048, 3061], [3095, 3101], [3125, 3130], [3189, 3196], [3237, 3250], [3412, 3426], [3468, 3476], [3571, 3579], [3673, 3681], [3696, 3704], [4266, 4276], [4281, 4294], [4492, 4510], [4516, 4524], [4584, 4596], [5041, 5049], [5074, 5083], [5400, 5408]], "wikipedia_ids": [446642, 3434750, 871552, 5043324, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 30297, 30297, 534366, 33057, 30297, 3356, 30297, 30297, 5043544, 48728, 30297, 5043324, 30297, 30297, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 349303, 3434750, 5843419, 22989, 3966054, 3434750, 5847204, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 3434750, 21648, 3434750, 47523415, 20740978, 23332, 3434750, 3434750, 446642], "wikipedia_titles": ["Snickers", "United States", "Presidency of Ronald Reagan", "Iraq War", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Tax", "Tax", "Barack Obama", "White House", "Tax", "Bill Clinton", "Tax", "Tax", "Democratic Party (United States)", "Social Security (United States)", "Tax", "Iraq War", "Tax", "Tax", "United States", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Saudi Arabia", "United States", "France", "Paris", "Mexico", "United States", "Chris Christie", "United States", "United States", "United States", "United States", "New Jersey", "United States", "World Trade Center", "The Pentagon", "Pennsylvania", "United States", "United States", "Snickers"]}

It draws in a TV audience of billions of people over a six week period in more than 200 countries across the globe.\nFormer England heroes Lawrence Dallaglio, Will Greenwood and Martin Corry joined VisitBritain and VisitEngland at a gala event in Auckland marking the beginning of the journey to the final at Twickenham in 2015. Along with world\u2019s media, they had a sneak preview of what fans and players can expect to see in 2015. The event took place inside the world\u2019s largest inflatable rugby ball, specially lit up as a giant St George's Cross.\nLaurence Bresh, Marketing Director at VisitBritain said: \u201cWe have shown the world that we have the ability and infrastructure to host some of the greatest sporting tournaments and much of the world agrees. With London 2012, the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014 and the Rugby World Cup in 2015, we have the perfect opportunity to highlight every region across the UK and build on the legacy of what will be a golden period for sports tourism in Britain.\u201d\nPaul Vaughan, Chief Executive of RWC2015 said: \u201cHosting the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England is a great honour. It is the World\u2019s third largest sporting event and that brings a lot of responsibility to ensure that we deliver the best tournament possible and a strong legacy. New Zealand have set the bar high which means our job is more challenging. Sport and large sporting events are always well received in Britain and we expect to see large numbers of overseas visitors coming in to enjoy what Britain has to offer as well as the Rugby\u201d\nVisitEngland ambassador and legendary rugby player Martin Corry said: \"The 2015 tournament is a fantastic opportunity for England. Not only because we intend to emulate New Zealand and get to the final as the host nation and hot favourites, but because it is a chance to showcase all that our country has to offer. With matches taking place throughout England - from Newcastle to Southampton - the Rugby World Cup means visitors from around the world will be able to enjoy our incredible countryside, seaside and cities.\"\nNearly two million overseas visitors watch sport at venues across the UK each year, taking in the atmosphere at famous rugby grounds such as Murrayfield in Edinburgh, Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium and at Twickenham, the home of English rugby.\nSporting visitors spend an average of \u00a3900 per trip, almost twice as much as what the \u2018average\u2019 overseas visitor would spend.

And there's was no sign of the \"movie\nstar.\" He was an entertainer; he joked, he sang, he soft\nshoed about, and even played the harmonica for a few songs. The\nshow is as good as any \"professional\" singer's. This\nis one actor-come-singer that could quit his day job - easily.\nSpacey,\nlead by Darin's own musical director Roger\nKellaway, belted out over a dozen songs particularly Darin-esque.\nAnd as tribute, Mr. Spacey even worked in many recognizable asides\nand \"Bobby-isms\" into the show's routine; none more\ncharming then an old schtick Darin liked to \"loosen the crowd\nup with\" about a drunk at a Hollywood bar impersonating all\nsorts of famous folks. This gave Kevin, an equally exquisite impersonator,\nthe chance to do his Burt Lancaster, Al Pacino, Katharine Hepburn,\nJerry Lewis, Johnny Carson, Jimmy Stewart and Marlon Brando voices.\nAs\na special treat, Peter Cincotti, who plays Bobby band mate Dick\nBehrkeis in the film, joined Kevin on stage, on piano, for a couple\nof songs - the audience erupted. As a whole, the 90 minute extravaganza\nshowcased a plethora of Darin's signature songs like, 'Mack the\nKnife', 'Dream Lover', 'Beyond the Sea', and 'Splish Splash',\nas well as Darin's personal favorites like 'If I Were a Carpenter',\n'That's All', 'Bridge Over Troubled Water', and 'Funny Valentine'.\nFor Darin fans, like myself, it was positively magical to hear\nthese songs live and with a full orchestra. To ad to the treasure\ntrove of auditory bliss, Spacey shared if the listeners were enjoying\nthe stylings of the music this evening, as well as on the soundtrack\nand in the film, they had Dodd Darin and Steve Blauner to thank.\nThey had sent him Bobby's original charts and notes on how he\nwanted the songs played and these were those interpretations.\nThough\nthe evening's spotlight was firmly following Spacey, the event\nwas designed to \"shine the light back on Bobby Darin.\"\nAnd it shined like a beacon. Mission accomplished. Song after\nsong, many written by Darin, were brilliantly orchestrated as\nSpacey showed his genuine abilities for crooning and playing with\nan audience. When he sang Darin's 'A Simple Song Of Freedom',\nthe audience was cheering and seemed to agree that the once-again\ntimely anti-war song has just as important a message today as\nwhen Darin wrote it in protest of the Viet Nam fiasco.\nSpacey's\ncreated a beautiful film in Beyond the Sea, and know now\nas he swings across the country with this delightful ensemble,\nthis incredible and unique force of creative diversity, has managed\nto excel within yet another side of his many talents. The shows\nare sold out - but there's always someone lurking around the stage\ndoor with a ticket to sell. I suggest you bring a bag-o-cash and\nnegotiate well - 'cause this is one show you don't want\nto miss. If you just can't get to the show? Get over and purchase\nthe Beyond The Sea\n", "index": [[241, 255], [352, 363], [374, 386], [483, 491], [583, 588], [741, 750], [758, 763], [795, 801], [841, 849], [1078, 1083], [1201, 1216], [1221, 1232], [1293, 1298], [1310, 1320], [1382, 1393], [1593, 1598], [1630, 1635], [1710, 1716], [2158, 2164], [2286, 2291], [2347, 2356], [2412, 2417], [2475, 2489], [2491, 2500], [2502, 2519], [2521, 2532], [2534, 2547], [2549, 2562], [2567, 2580], [2609, 2623], [2635, 2640], [2685, 2690], [2820, 2825], [2869, 2880], [2884, 2898], [2933, 2938], [3005, 3031], [3061, 3066], [3211, 3217], [3408, 3413], [3566, 3572], [3625, 3636], [3723, 3728], [3763, 3769], [3855, 3860], [4024, 4029], [4057, 4065], [4074, 4080], [4111, 4125], [4593, 4607]], "wikipedia_ids": [2137039, 100161, 16768, 3434750, 16768, 447621, 100161, 16768, 3434750, 16768, 2381112, 18110, 100161, 594010, 100161, 100161, 16768, 16768, 16768, 100161, 84485, 16768, 4537, 41906, 43337, 15967, 99959, 16273, 19903, 2437864, 100161, 16768, 100161, 4155045, 2137039, 100161, 634661, 100161, 16768, 100161, 16768, 100161, 100161, 16768, 100161, 100161, 202354, 16768, 2137039, 2137039], "wikipedia_titles": ["Beyond the Sea", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "United States", "Kevin Spacey", "Las Vegas Strip", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "United States", "Kevin Spacey", "Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre", "Los Angeles", "Bobby Darin", "Sandra Dee", "Bobby Darin", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "Kevin Spacey", "Kevin Spacey", "Bobby Darin", "Hollywood", "Kevin Spacey", "Burt Lancaster", "Al Pacino", "Katharine Hepburn", "Jerry Lewis", "Johnny Carson", "James Stewart", "Marlon Brando", "Peter Cincotti", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "Bobby Darin", "Dream Lover", "Beyond the Sea", "Bobby Darin", "Bridge over Troubled Water (song)", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "Bobby Darin", "Bobby Darin", "Kevin Spacey", "Bobby Darin", "Bobby Darin", "Vietnam", "Kevin Spacey", "Beyond the Sea", "Beyond the Sea"]}

The genocidal campaigns and colonial settlement of the Americas and Australia and the libidinous genetic infusion into the gene pools of every racial type that succumbed to its campaigns of terror and destruction evidence the insane barbarism of the \u201cWestern man\u201d and his \u2018civilization\u201d. These historic conditions partially frame the condition of the Afrikan world at the close of the 20th century.\u201d The Sankofa Movement ReAfrikanization and the Reality o War by Kwame Agyei & Akua Nson Akoto Page 11\nThe Don Imus issue is gradually making its way to the back burner of media exposure and thus our consciousness, the ruling elites having decided that\u2019s enough of that. Now we are being bombarded by the media giving us minute by minuet coverage of the carnage and slaying on the campus of Virginia Tech. In the backdrop the ongoing war and occupation of Iraq and the incessant Sabre rattling directed at Iran is just enough to keep us on edge as the beat goes on. Meanwhile, black folks continue to degrade, debase and kill each other at an ever increasingly alarming rate.\nI was watching the Oprah Winfrey television show yesterday, her \u201cTown Meeting\u201d focusing on the Don Imus brouhaha when the local ABC affiliate interrupted her program to provide more information on the situation at Virginia Tech. Prior to the interruption psychologist Dr. Robin Smith was explaining to Oprah and her audience the Don Imus incident was not\nreally about Don Imus, it was actually deeply indicative of the spiritual void at the core of AmeriKKKa. She explained it was not just the Rutgers student athletes who were being demeaned, it was all of AmeriKKKa. She said succinctly that anytime a person denigrates another they also tear themselves. Dr. Smith is on the case on this one. When we look at AmeriKKKa we see a nation with a long and continuous history of wanton violence, bloodletting, genocide and rapine.\nThe Europeans who invaded and settled this hemisphere brought their culture of war, pillage, plunder social and ecological disruption with them. In fact they have carried that tradition everywhere they have set foot on planet earth! Given this is their historical legacy, why are we shocked at a Don Imus who spews insults and epithets at black people in an effort to \u201centertain\u201d his mostly white male listeners. Words are an outgrowth of thoughts as are actions. Take a look around and ask yourself what are the real values AmeriKKKa disseminates to the world?\nNow white pretend to be shocked at what happened at Virginia Tech just like they did at Columbine High School years ago. Nonsense! These are the real notions white AmeriKKKa holds dear. The killers are merely expressing the real motives, values and psychology of AmeriKKKa.\nDr. Amos Wilson once noted white people\u2019s true psychology and values aren\u2019t found in their psychology books or their religious dogma, their real values are found in their history. As tragic as the murders were at Virginia Tech a brother reminded us via E-mail that the biggest murder spree in AmeriKKKa took place in Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921 when rampaging whites went berserk and burned thirty-five blocks in the black neighborhood of Greenwood in North Tulsa. Even the National Guard who were called in to restore order turned on the blacks who had armed to defended themselves against the marauding mob, opening fire on the blacks who were huddled together to defend themselves against vicious attack.\nWhat do you expect in the most violent country on the face of the earth? This is just one example of the state using its considerable powers to turn on the indigenous inhabitants of this land as well as the Africans they imported here! What the National Guard no longer does to black folks in AmeriKKKa it now does to Iraqis in Iraq under the guise of a bogus War on Terrorism. The hatred white folks used to spew on blacks in 1921 with impunity Don Imus now does on the radio in 2007. Only this time his corporate master\u2019s kicked him off the train to save their hides when the pressure got a little to high for them. It is business as usual for the barbarians. The most tragic aspect of all this is we have internalized the barbarians\u2019 fear and loathing of Africans. Our children now degrade and act out every vile and negative stereotype created in the demented psyches of European males. This is not by accident. The Europeans discovered long ago the best way to dummy us down, stupify and neutralize us was to use our own music as a weapon on us! Just when our young people were using the new genre of Hip-Hop to carry on the liberation struggle, the white corporate oligarchy altered the music scene and provided a counter to conscious rappers like Public Enemy and KRS-One. They began to promote degenerates like 2 Live Crew and NWA. Before long a new substrata of Hip-Hop a rough, gritty and sociopathic style called Gangsta Rap took root in the hood, it was aggressively promoted on the white owned cable, FM stations and later in films and videos.\nWhen wise elders like C. Delores Tucker and Rev. Calvin Butts stepped up to warn us about the potentially negative and damaging impact of Gangsta Rap in the \u201890's they were viciously attacked mocked and derided by apolitical retrograde corporate mercenaries. Two years ago when Bill Cosby stood up to challenge the insanity he too was vilified by the corporate stooges and lackeys. These uncultured synchophats denounced their detractors under the guise of cultural authenticity, saying they were \u201ckeeping it real\u201d. Their lack of historical insight was matched only by their arrogance. These semi literate buffoons actually think their retrograde brand of creativity is the first form of black music to be authentic and true to the black experience! Since most of them are not real musicians they know nothing about the Blues, or the circumstances, situations and artists that created them. Or anything else that flowed from the black experience.\nBut the truth of the matter is, we must assume responsibility for their ignorance. We failed to teach them our history. We failed to connect them with the struggles of men on the chain gangs, on the plantations who created the work songs and shouts. We neglected to tell them about the struggles Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Sam Cook or Veejay Records waged for artistic freedom and a real pay day. Now these chickens have come home to roost in our homes and communities. Don Imus got fired over his latest racist remarks even though our reaction was misguided. If Imus got fired, how is it a whole pack of decadent \u201cblack\u201d slime merchants gets a free pass to degrade and perpetual the vilest stereotypes against their own people? How do sane people allow this to happen?\nHow does the ruling oligarchy dupe the masses of AmeriKKKans into allowing them to kill, maim and steal the natural resources of Iraq, Haiti, Afghanistan or whatever country you want in the blank. How is it there is no outcry over the more than 600,000 Iraqis the US has slaughtered during the past four years? These things happen for the same reasons there was no outcry against the slaughter of the Native Americans or African people. The so called good white folks lack the will to change things. We as African people are too impotent to stop the escalating fratricide in our communities, the prostitution of our creativity and the use of our genius to subjugate, castrate and dehumanize ourselves. That is the bottom line! We seem to have lost the\nwill to resist, redeem ourselves or fight for our survival. One Afrocentric psychologist says we suffer from \u201csurvival fatigue\u201d we\u2019re too beat down to resist and fight for our survival.\nI suspect we suffer more from what I call the sell out syndrome than anything else. Our kids don\u2019t know who we/they are,. They don\u2019t know the resilient and strong people they come from, all they know is they don\u2019t want to be African\n", "index": [[2460, 2468], [2744, 2757], [2809, 2813], [2859, 2863], [3397, 3405], [3478, 3487], [3523, 3530], [3587, 3596], [3740, 3749], [3860, 3869], [4152, 4160], [4470, 4483], [4506, 4527], [4582, 4591], [4681, 4690], [4905, 4918], [4985, 4994], [5009, 5023], [5126, 5135], [5161, 5175], [5602, 5610], [5640, 5654], [5688, 5697], [5713, 5719], [5723, 5727], [5755, 5771], [5841, 5849], [6153, 6161], [6270, 6278], [6315, 6324], [6501, 6508], [6649, 6661], [6666, 6673], [6730, 6733], [6766, 6773], [6819, 6830], [6909, 6911], [6974, 6991], [7001, 7013], [7090, 7101], [7230, 7240], [7772, 7777], [8195, 8209], [8211, 8225], [8227, 8235], [8239, 8253], [8374, 8382], [8467, 8471], [9490, 9501], [9837, 9844]], "wikipedia_ids": [539600, 239897, 7515928, 14653, 539600, 12290624, 80135, 12290624, 12290624, 9239, 539600, 239897, 379497, 12290624, 12290624, 239897, 12290624, 150969, 1521454, 37988, 5334607, 37988, 12290624, 7515928, 7515928, 13425800, 539600, 5334607, 9239, 9239, 18945847, 22841, 23369739, 21149, 18945847, 12212, 1607203, 2905506, 4673809, 12212, 158894, 3352, 54408, 50420, 147343, 331387, 539600, 539600, 194624, 5334607], "wikipedia_titles": ["Don Imus", "Virginia Tech", "Iraq", "Iran", "Don Imus", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "Rutgers University", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "Europe", "Don Imus", "Virginia Tech", "Columbine High School", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "Virginia Tech", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Greenwood District, Tulsa", "National Guard (United States)", "Africa", "National Guard (United States)", "AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted", "Iraq", "Iraq", "War on terror", "Don Imus", "Africa", "Europe", "Europe", "Hip hop music", "Public Enemy", "KRS-One", "N.W.A", "Hip hop music", "Gangsta rap", "FM broadcasting", "C.

But there\nis something quite pestilently Pecksniffian about\nshrinking from a hard task on the plea that it is not\nhard enough. If a man will really try talking to the\nten beggars who come to his door he will soon find\nout whether it is really so much easier than the\nlabour of writing a cheque for a hospital.\n'What's Wrong with the World.'\nMARCH 4th\nBUT the man we see every day -- the worker in\nMr. Gradgrind's factory, the little clerk in\nMr. Gradgrind's office -- he is too mentally\nworried to believe in freedom. He is kept quiet with\nrevolutionary literature. He is calmed and kept in\nhis place by a constant succession of wild philosophies.\nHe is a Marxian one day, a Nietzscheite\nthe next day, a Superman (probably) the next\nday, and a slave every day. The only thing that\nremains after all the philosophies is the factory.\nThe only man who gains by all the philosophies is\nGradgrind. It would be worth his while to keep his\ncommercial helotry supplied with sceptical literature.\nAnd now I come to think of it, of course, Gradgrind\nis famous for giving libraries. He shows his sense:\nall modern books are on his side. As long as the\nvision of heaven is always changing, the vision of\nearth will be exactly the same. No ideal will\nremain long enough to be realized, or even partly\nrealized. The modern young man will never change\nhis environment, for he will always change his\nmind.\n'Orthodoxy.'\nMARCH 5th\nPROGRESS should mean that we are always\nwalking towards the New Jerusalem. It does\nmean that the New Jerusalem is always\nwalking away from us. We are not altering the\nreal to suit the ideal. We are altering the ideal:\nit is easier.\n'Orthodoxy.'\nMARCH 6th\nIN a very entertaining work, over which we have\nroared in childhood, it is stated that a point\nhas no parts and no magnitude. Humility is\nthe luxurious art of reducing ourselves to a point, not\nto a small thing or a large one, but to a thing with\nno size at all, so that to it all the cosmic things are\nwhat they really are -- of immeasurable stature.\n'The Defendant.'\nMARCH 7th\nTHUS because we are not in a civilization which\nbelieves strongly in oracles or sacred places,\nwe see the full frenzy of those who killed\nthemselves to find the sepulchre of Christ. But\nbeing in a civilization which does believe in this\ndogma of fact for fact's sake, we do not see the full\nfrenzy of those who kill themselves to find the North Pole. I am not speaking of a tenable ultimate\nutility, which is true both of the Crusades and the\npolar explorations. I mean merely that we do see\nthe superficial and aesthetic singularity, the startling\nquality, about the idea of men crossing a continent\nwith armies to conquer the place where a man died.\nBut we do not see the aesthetic singularity and the\nstartling quality of men dying in agonies to find a\nplace where no man can live -- a place only interesting\nbecause it is supposed to be the meeting-place\nof some lines that do not exist.\n'Heretics.'\nMARCH 8th\nIN one of his least convincing phrases, Nietzsche\nhad said that just as the ape ultimately produced\nthe man, so should we ultimately produce\nsomething higher than the man. The immediate\nanswer, of course, is sufficiently obvious: the ape\ndid not worry about the man, so why should we\nworry about the superman? If the superman will\ncome by natural selection, may we not leave it to\nnatural selection? If the superman will come by\nhuman selection, what sort of superman are we to\nselect? If he is simply to be more just, more brave,\nor more merciful, then Zarathustra sinks into a\nSunday-school teacher; the only way we can work\nfor it is to be more just, more brave, and more\nmerciful -- sensible advice, but hardly startling.\nIf he is to be anything else than this, why should\nwe desire him, or what else are we to desire?\nThese questions have been many times asked of\nthe Nietzscheites, and none of the Nietzscheites have\neven attempted to answer them.\n'George Bernard Shaw.'\nMARCH 9th\nA MAN can be a Christian to the end of the\nworld, for the simple reason that a man\ncould have been an Atheist from the beginning\nof it. The materialism of things is on the face\nof things: it does not require any science to find it\nout. A man who has lived and loved falls down\ndead and the worms eat him. That is Materialism,\nif you like. That is Atheism, if you like. If mankind\nhas believed in spite of that, it can believe in\nspite of anything. But why our human lot is made\nany more hopeless because we know the names of\nthe worms who eat him, or the names of all the\nparts of him that they eat, is to a thoughtful mind\nsomewhat difficult to discover.\n'All Things Considered.'\nMARCH 10th\nWE should probably come considerably nearer to\nthe true conception of things if we treated all\ngrown-up persons, of all titles and types, with\nprecisely that dark affection and dazed respect with\nwhich we treat the infantile limitations. A child\nhas no difficulty in achieving the miracle of speech,\nconsequently we find his blunders almost as marvellous\nas his accuracy. If we only adopted the same\nattitude towards Premiers and Chancellors of the\nExchequer, if we genially encouraged their stammering\nand delightful attempts at human speech,\nwe should be in a far more wise and tolerant\ntemper.\n'The Defendant.'\nMARCH 11th\nWHEN the working women in the poor districts\ncome to the doors of the public-houses and\ntry to get their husbands home, simple-minded\n'social workers' always imagine that\nevery husband is a tragic drunkard and every wife\na broken-hearted saint. It never occurs to them\nthat the poor woman is only doing under coarser\nconventions exactly what every fashionable hostess\ndoes when she tries to get the men from arguing over\nthe cigars to come and gossip over the teacups.\n'What's Wrong with the World.'\nMARCH 12th\nWHAT have we done, and where have we\nwandered, we that have produced sages who\ncould have spoken with Socrates and poets\nwho could walk with Dante, that we should talk\nas if we had never done anything more intelligent\nthan found colonies and kick niggers? We are the\nchildren of light, and it is we that sit in darkness,\nIf we are judged, it will not be for the merely\nintellectual transgression of failing to appreciate other\nnations, but for the supreme spiritual transgression\nof failing to appreciate ourselves.\n'The Defendant.'\nMARCH 13th\nAND for those who talk to us with interfering\neloquence about Jaeger and the pores of the\nskin, and about Plasmon and the coats of the\nstomach, at them shall only be hurled the words\nthat are hurled at fops and gluttons, 'Take no\nthought what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,\nor wherewithal ye shall be clothed. For after all\nthese things do the Gentiles seek. But seek ye first\nthe Kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and\nall these things shall be added unto you.'\n'Heretics.'\nMARCH 14th\nTHE Christian admits that the universe is manifold\nand even miscellaneous, just as a sane man\nknows that he is complex. Nay, the really\nsane man knows that he has a touch of the madman.\nBut the Materialist's world is quite simple and\nsolid, just as the madman is quite sure he is sane.\nThe Materialist is sure that history has been simply\nand solely a chain of causation, just as the interesting\nperson before mentioned is quite sure that he\nis simply and solely a chicken. Materialists and\nmadmen never have doubts.\n'Orthodoxy.'\nMARCH 15th\nTHE modern world (intent on anarchy in everything,\neven in Government) refuses to perceive\nthe permanent element of tragic constancy\nwhich inheres in all passion, and which is the\norigin of marriage. Marriage rests upon the fact\nthat you cannot have your cake and eat it; that\nyou cannot lose your heart and have it.\nIntroduction to 'David Copperfield.'\nMARCH 16th\nMORALITY did not begin by one man saying\nto another, 'I will not hit you if you do not\nhit me '; there is no trace of such a transaction.\nThere is a trace of both men having said,\n'We must not hit each other in the holy place.'\nThey gained their morality by guarding their\nreligion. They did not cultivate courage. They\nfought for the shrine, and found they had become\ncourageous. They did not cultivate cleanliness.\nThey purified themselves for the altar, and found\nthat they were clean. The history of the Jews is\nthe only early document known to most Englishmen,\nand the facts can be judged sufficiently from that.\nThe Ten Commandments which have been found\nsubstantially common to mankind were merely\nmilitary commands a code of regimental orders,\nissued to protect a certain ark across a certain desert.\nAnarchy was evil because it endangered the sanctity.\nAnd only when they made a holy day for God did\nthey find they had made a holiday for men.\n'Orthodoxy.'\nMARCH 17th\nST. PATRICK'S DAY\nTHE average autochthonous Irishman is close\nto patriotism because he is close to the earth;\nhe is close to domesticity because he is close\nto the earth; he is close to doctrinal theology and\nelaborate ritual because he is close to the earth.\nIn short, he is close to the heavens because he is\nclose to the earth.\n'George Bernard Shaw.'\nMARCH 18th\nWE men and women are all in the same boat,\nupon a stormy sea. We owe to each other\na terrible and tragic loyalty. If we catch\nsharks for food, let them be killed most mercifully\nlet anyone who likes love the sharks, and pet the\nsharks, and tie ribbons round their necks and give\nthem sugar and teach them to dance. But if once a\nman suggests that a shark is to be valued against a\nsailor, or that the poor shark might be permitted\nto bite off a nigger's leg occasionally, then I would\ncourt-martial the man -- he is a traitor to the ship.\n'All Things Considered.'\nMARCH 19th\nEVERY statute is a declaration of war, to be\nbacked by arms. Every tribunal is a revolutionary\ntribunal. In a republic all punishment\nis as sacred and solemn as lynching.\n'What's Wrong with the World.'\nMARCH 20th\nI HAVE no sympathy with international aggression\nwhen it is taken seriously, but I have a\ncertain dark and wild sympathy with it when\nit is quite absurd. Raids are all wrong as practical\npolitics, but they are human and imaginable as\npractical jokes. In fact, almost any act of ragging\nor violence can be forgiven on this strict condition --\nthat it is of no use at all to anybody. If the aggression\ngets anything out of it, then it is quite unpardonable.\nIt is damned by the least hint of utility or profit.\nA man of spirit and breeding may brawl, but he does\nnot steal. A gentleman knocks off his friend's\nhat, but he does not annex his friend's hat.\n'All Things Considered.'\nMARCH 21st\nMODERN and cultured persons, I believe, object\nto their children seeing kitchen company or\nbeing taught by a woman like Peggotty.\nBut surely it is more important to be educated in a\nsense of human dignity and equality than in anything\nelse in the world. And a child who has once\nhad to respect a kind and capable woman of the\nlower classes will respect the lower classes for ever.\nThe true way to overcome the evil in class distinctions\nis not to denounce them as revolutionists\ndenounce them, but to ignore them as children\nignore them.\n'Charles Dickens.'\nMARCH 22nd\nTHERE is no clearer sign of the absence of\noriginality among modern poets than their\ndisposition to find new topics. Really\noriginal poets write poems about the spring. They\nare always fresh, just as the spring is always fresh.\nMen wholly without originality write poems about\ntorture, or new religions, or some perversion of\nobscenity, hoping that the mere sting of the subject\nmay speak for them. But we do not sufficiently\nrealize that what is true of the classic ode is also\ntrue of the classic joke. A true poet writes about\nthe spring being beautiful because (after a thousand\nsprings) the spring really is beautiful. In the same\nway the true humorist writes about a man sitting\ndown on his hat because the act of sitting down on\none's own hat (however often and admirably\nperformed) really is extremely funny. We must not\ndismiss a new poet because his poem is called 'To\na Skylark'; nor must we dismiss a humorist\nbecause his new farce is called 'My Mother-in-Law.'\nHe may really have splendid and inspiring things\nto say upon an eternal problem. The whole\nquestion is whether he has.\nIntroduction to 'Sketches by Boz.'\nMARCH 23rd\nMAN is an exception, whatever else he is. If\nhe is not the image of God, then he is a\ndisease of the dust. If it is not true that\na divine being fell, then we can only say that one\nof the animals went entirely off its head.\n'All Things Considered.'\nMARCH 24th\nSOCIAL reformers have fired a hundred shots\nagainst the public-house, but never one\nagainst its really shameful character. The\nsign of decay is not in the public-house, but in\nthe private bar; or rather the row of five or six\nprivate bars, into each of which a respectable\ndipsomaniac can go in solitude, and by indulging his\nown half-witted sin violates his own half-witted\nmorality. Nearly all these places are equipped\nwith an atrocious apparatus of ground-glass\nwindows which can be so closed that they practically\nconceal the face of the buyer from the seller.\nWords cannot express the abysses of human\ninfamy and hateful shame expressed by that\nelaborate piece of furniture. Whenever I go into\na public-house, which happens fairly often, I\nalways carefully open all these apertures and then\nleave the place in every way refreshed.\n'George Bernard Shaw.'\nMARCH 25th\nLADY DAY\nFEARFULLY plain the flowers grew,\nLike a child's book to read,\nOr like a friend's face seen in a glass.\nHe looked, and there Our Lady was;\nShe stood and stroked the tall live grass\nAs a man strokes his steed.\nHer face was like a spoken word\nWhen brave men speak and choose,\nThe very colours of her coat\nWere better than good news . . .\n'The gates of heaven are tightly locked,\nWe do not guard our gain,\nThe heaviest hind may easily\nCome silently and suddenly\nUpon me in a lane.\n'And any little maid that walks\nIn good thoughts apart,\nMay break the guard of the Three Kings,\nAnd see the dear and dreadful things\nI hid within my heart.'\n'Ballad of Alfred.'\nMARCH 26th\nIT is one of the mean and morbid modern lies\nthat physical courage is connected with\ncruelty. The Tolstoian and Kiplingite are\nnowhere more at one than in maintaining this.\nThey have, I believe, some small sectarian quarrel\nwith each other: the one saying that courage\nmust be abandoned because it is connected with\ncruelty, and the other maintaining that cruelty\nis charming because it is a part of courage. But\nit is all, thank God, a lie. An energy and boldness\nof body may make a man stupid or reckless or dull\nor drunk or hungry, but it does not make him\nspiteful.\n'What's Wrong with the World.'\nMARCH 27th\nFOR human beings, being children, have the\nchildish wilfulness and the childish secrecy.\nAnd they never have from the beginning\nof the world done what the wise men have seen\nto be inevitable.\n'The Napoleon of Notting Hill.'\nMARCH 28th\nCRUELTY to animals is cruelty and a vile\nthing; but cruelty to a man is not cruelty;\nit is treason. Tyranny over a man is not\ntyranny: it is rebellion, for man is royal. Now,\nthe practical weakness of the vast mass of modern\npity for the poor and the oppressed is precisely\nthat it is merely pity; the pity is pitiful, but not\nrespectful. Men feel that the cruelty to the poor\nis a kind of cruelty to animals. They never feel\nthat it is injustice to equals; nay, it is treachery\nto comrades. This dark, scientific pity, this\nbrutal pity, has an elemental sincerity of its own,\nbut it is entirely useless for all ends of social reform.\nDemocracy swept Europe with the sabre when it\nwas founded upon the Rights of Man. It has done\nliterally nothing at all since it has been founded\nonly upon the wrongs of man. Or, more strictly\nspeaking, its recent failure has been due to its\nnot admitting the existence of any rights or wrongs,\nor indeed of any humanity. Evolution (the\nsinister enemy of revolution) does not especially\ndeny the existence of God: what it does deny\nis the existence of man.

Less questionable is the negative effect their policies will have\non the world\u2019s poor, who will remain poor if the radical environmentalists get\ntheir way.\nEven\nsomething as seemingly innocuous as the \u201ccarbon offsets\u201d favored by Al Gore and\nhis ilk can end up keeping the Third World in poverty. According to a recent\nheadline in the London Times, \u201cTo cancel out the CO2 of a return\nflight to India, it will take one poor villager three years of pumping water by\nfoot. So is carbon offsetting the best way to ease your conscience?\u201d Why use a\nfoot pump in the 21st century? Because for offsetting to work, poor people\nworldwide have to continue using outdated, nonpolluting technology at the cost\nof their own advancement and prosperity. Some have fairly called this\neco-enslavement.

The locals strongly support the project and want the jobs, improved port, sustained development, and improved living standards and environmental quality this state-of-the-art operation will bring....\nBut Fenn claims the mine will change the \"quaint\" village and harm the environment. He says he feels \"like a resident,\" his children \"were born and raised\" there, and the locals \"don't consider education to be important\" and would just spend their money on parties, jeans, and stereos.\n(To read more, click here.)\nGreen\nActivists Hurt the World's Poor: An Interview with Paul Driessen\nBy James\nM.

It was anything but. The scoreline of 1-1 at the end of the first day\u2019s play doesn\u2019t tell half the story.\nThere may be a discrepancy of 1,433 places in the combined rankings of the Australian and Swiss teams, but the Fed Cup, as we all know, is a great leveller and the host nation came back to square the tie in a quite extraordinary second rubber.\nStefanie Voegele, leading Switzerland for the first time following the retirement of Patty Schnyder, and the higher ranked \u2013 by some 99 places \u2013 Jarmila Gajdosova went toe-to-toe like two old bare knuckle fighters with no quarter given.\nThe outcome was in doubt right until the end of its two hour 28-minute duration when the Australian, after saving seven match points, finally succumbed 60 67(8) 86.\nPurists would have said it was far too hit-and-miss to be a classic and certainly it did seem as if neither player knew the meaning of the word \u201crally\u201d, but it was incredibly exciting after the one-way traffic of the opening set and it had the Swiss fans hollering and cheering throughout the finale at the Fribourg Forum.\nRoger Federer, Mardy Fish and company have it all to do next week to conjure something half as gripping in their Davis Cup tie here.\nAustralia remain the favourites but Christiane Jolissaint, the Swiss captain, expects the opposition to bring in Jelena Dokic for Gajdosova against Timea Bacsinszky on day two in the second of the reverse singles.\nFive games into the opening rubber of her match against Samantha Stosur, Bacsinszky looked more like the one to be stood down.\nPlaying her first serious tennis since seriously injuring her foot in an off-court incident last April the young Swiss, understandably, looked out of her depth against the world No. 5 Stosur. But both she and her captain will have been encouraged by the way she eventually made a match of it before losing 62 75.\nBacsinszky lost the opening five games as her serve deserted her. Jolissaint could not understand why because she had served so well in practice, although credit to her for holding serve in the sixth game when she served three double faults.\nShe\u2019s clearly a fighter, though, and despite surrendering the first set she then went on a run where she won five out of six games to take a three-love lead in the second set.\nAlthough Stosur\u2019s signature shot, the forehand drive volley, was working sweetly enough, the rest of her game has yet to return to the level of last year when she won the US Open. Nevertheless, she was still too good for Bacsinszky, even if the Swiss player\u2019s ranking of No. 241 is clearly misleading.\nTalking of rankings, David Taylor, the Australian captain, thought Voegele played way above her ranking of No. 138 in defeating Gajdosova. The two had never met before but there was nothing tentative about their approach to the match.\nPartly because the clay court here is much quicker than most and partly because of Gajdosova\u2019s hit-and-miss style the match turned into the tennis equivalent of a slugfest.\nAfter losing the first set 60 there seemed no way back for the Australian but in an amazing about-turn she raced into a 5-1 lead in the second set. Both players ruthlessly punished their opponent\u2019s second serve and even, on occasion, the first.\nThen Voegele won the next four games and it was a brave man who could predict the outcome of this match. Even the second set tiebreak was full of twists and turns, Gajdosova taking a 4-0 lead before pegged back to 6-6.

Raised by a single mom, the President has always been vocal about how important it is for men to step up as fathers, particularly in the African-American community. The White House is acknowledging the negative impact a father\u2019s absence has on children, and that even those fathers who are active in their children\u2019s lives sometimes need support. This week, the White House kicked off the \u201cStrong Fathers, Strong Families\u201d initiative to make this time of the year special for dads:Discounts:The White House teamed up with several organizations including local bowling alleys, the WNBA, LivingSocial and Groupon to offer discounts for certain events so that fathers can spend more quality time with their families. Check out this weekend\u2019s zoo discount at http://www.aza.org/fathersday/.Special screenings:As a part of the First Lady\u2019s Joining Forces movement, major movie studios including Warner Brothers and Disney will host movie screenings for military families throughout the year. Yesterday, military dads and their kids joined the President for a screening of \"Cars 2.\"Spotlight:Through the \u201cChampions of Change\u201d program, the White House will honor 12 dads from around the country who are committed to providing for their children and positively impacting their communities. From the Heart: The President penned an op-ed in People magazine that described his relationship with his children. He wrote, \u201cI've learned that children don't just need us physically present, but emotionally available \u2013 willing to listen and pay attention and participate in their daily lives.\u201dPresident Obama knows that one of the best ways to encourage fathers to take responsibility is to set an example. He connects with his daughters by eating dinner with his family most nights of the week, and even serving as an assistant coach for Sasha\u2019s basketball team.

Blood sugar limbo: How low should it go?\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are encouraged to keep their\nblood sugar levels low, and the usual goal is a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)\nlevel of 7% or lower. But is 7% ambitious enough? Results from three clinical\ntrials showed that the single-minded pursuit of low blood sugar levels is\nprobably not the best approach to type 2 diabetes, particularly in people ages\n60 and older.\nPeople with diabetes should not give up blood sugar\ncontrol. Data show that it lowers the risk of kidney disorders, eye disorders,\nand other problems related to damage of small blood vessels (microvascular\ndisease).\nBut 2008\u2019s bumper crop of diabetes research has shown that\nit\u2019s unwise to be overzealous about blood sugar lowering \u2014 moderation in all\nthings! \u2014 and certainly not without also attending to risk factors like high\nblood pressure and cholesterol.\n2. 80 ain\u2019t old\nThe age limit for controlling high blood pressure \u2014 usually\nwith medication \u2014 has crept up as research results have shown that it prevents\nstrokes, heart attacks, and heart failure in the old and young alike.\nResults from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial\n(HYVET) topped off that trend by showing that for those 80 and older reining in\nhigh blood pressure pays off. After two years, the treated group in the study\nhad lower rates of heart failure, strokes, and overall mortality, which was\nespecially important because previous research suggested a decrease in strokes\nmight be offset by an increase in deaths from other causes.\nHYVET is more evidence that the age for effective medical\nintervention \u2014 be it pills, surgery, or devices \u2014 is getting older and older.\n3. Gene tests: Progress and Pandora\u2019s box\nIn 2008, personalized medicine (or pharmacogenomics, as it\nis sometimes called if drug choices are involved) inched closer to becoming\npart of everyday medicine. Doctors have started to order gene tests to assess\nhow sensitive people are to warfarin (Coumadin), the anti\u2013blood clotting drug.\nResearchers reported that heart-failure patients with a certain genetic profile\nresponded well to bucindolol, a beta blocker that had fallen out of favor\nbecause it wasn\u2019t very effective in the average patient. And results from a\nsubstudy of a large blood pressure trial traced differences in the response to\ndiuretics back to a particular gene.\nMeanwhile, many direct-to-the-consumer genetic tests hit the\nmarket. Several companies are using the same DNA chips as researchers to sell\ngenome scans, readouts of several hundred thousand genetic variations\u00a0 that have been associated with diseases and\nother traits.\nThe commercial tests have raised some concerns. Will they be\ndone correctly? And even if they are, at this stage, the predictive powers may\nbe oversold, unduly scaring some while giving false assurances to others.\nMoreover, the take-home message would be the same: lose weight, exercise, eat\nmore fruit and vegetables.\n4. Seeing right through you and its dangers\nA half-dozen imaging technologies allow doctors to see\nwhat\u2019s going on inside the body. The workhorse, though, is computed tomography\n(CT), which uses a computer to assemble multiple cross-sectional x-rays into\nremarkably detailed pictures. A new generation of machines, called\nmultidetector CT scanners, are making the pictures even faster and incredibly\nsharp.\nBy some estimates, doctors in the United States ordered over 60\nmillion CT scans this year, double the number ordered in the late 1990s.\nBut are we going to pay a price for all these pictures? The\nradiation from CT scans is much higher than from traditional imaging tests.\nStarting in 2007 and continuing into 2008, researchers at Columbia University\nhave published several provocative papers about the cancers that these CT scans\nmay cause. According to their projections, our current exposure to CT scans\nmight be responsible for between 1.5% and 2% of all cancers a few decades from\nnow (it takes years for the cancers to develop).\nDoctors need to eliminate unnecessary do-overs. And using\nother imaging tests when possible could reduce radiation exposure.\n5. War wounds that don\u2019t show\nOne of the grim aspects of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been the widespread\nuse of small-scale bombs \u2014 in military jargon, improvised explosive devices\n(IEDs) \u2014 in suicide attacks and roadside booby traps. Many American soldiers\nsurvive these explosions because of protective gear, but by no means do they\nescape unscathed. In addition to terrible leg, arm, and other sorts of obvious\nphysical injury, there are brain injuries that may have long-lasting effects.\nPsychiatrists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research\nreported the results of a study that counted the number of mild traumatic brain\ninjuries \u2014 or, more simply put, concussions \u2014 among returning troops. About 15%\n(384 of 2,525) gave answers that suggested they had suffered a mild traumatic\nbrain injury of some kind. Probing a bit further, the Walter Reed researchers\nfound that almost half (54 of 123) of the soldiers whose concussions had caused\na loss of consciousness met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD), and about a quarter of them were suffering from major depression.\nIt\u2019s difficult to separate the concussions suffered in a war\nfrom the life-threatening stress under which they occur. The Army researchers\nbelieve that there\u2019s a great deal of overlap between PTSD and the ill-defined\nconsequences of wartime concussions. Regardless if the cause is stress,\nconcussion, or some mixture, the veterans of these wars who have memory\nproblems, difficulty concentrating, headaches, and other \u201cinvisible\u201d injuries\nmust get the care they need and deserve.\n6. Generic Rx: Shopping for health care in the global village\nOnce the exception, generic drugs are now the norm. In 2008,\nabout two-thirds of the prescriptions written by doctors were for generic\ndrugs.\nGeneric drugs have taken off for many reasons. Brand-name\nblockbusters (Fosamax, Pravachol, Zocor, Zoloft) have lost their patent\nprotection in recent years. Cost shifting by insurers and tiered pricing have\nsteered doctors and their patients to the generic script. Large retailers like\nWal-Mart have used generics as loss leaders simply to get people into their\nstores. And the Medicare Part D prescription plans have loaded up their\nformularies with generics with only a sprinkling of brand-name drugs in between.\nBut a crucial, and largely underappreciated, factor has been\nthe role of low-cost suppliers, many of them in India. All the problems with\ncontaminated Chinese products don\u2019t need to be recounted here. So far, nothing\nas serious has occurred with Indian drugs, although the FDA has promised to\nstep up its overseas inspections.\n7. Awareness test doesn\u2019t make the grade\nBeing awake during surgery after being given general\nanesthesia is one of those bad dreams that does, very occasionally, come true.\nSeveral studies have found \u201canesthesia awareness\u201d to be a 1-in-1,000\noccurrence, although one study put it more in the hen\u2019s teeth territory of 1 in\n15,000. The bispectral index (BIS) is a formula that uses the values of\nmeasurements of the brain\u2019s electrical activity to come up with a single number\nthat\u2019s supposed to measure \u201canesthetic depth.\u201d But it\u2019s been controversial,\npartly because the company that sells it has kept the formula a proprietary\nsecret.\nResearchers at Washington University in St. Louis reported the results of a study\nthat tested the BIS monitoring in a 2,000-person randomized trial. Four people\nin the study experienced anesthesia awareness, two in the BIS-monitored group\nand two in the control group, and five others were rated as possibly being\nawake during their operations (false memories can occur), four in the\nBIS-monitored group and one in the control group. The investigators concluded\nthat BIS-guided anesthesia was no better at identifying anesthesia awareness\nthan another kind of monitoring.\nThis is another case when the results of an independent\nclinical trial have called into question the value of a widely adopted medical\npractice.\n8. Health care reform: If not soon, when?\nSome argue that the new political leadership will be hard\npressed to take on something so organizationally and politically complicated as\nhealth care reform during an economic downturn. The counterpoint: health care\nreform is essential for any kind of durable recovery.\nRegardless of how reform efforts play out in the long run,\nhere are a few, quite gloomy\u00a0 predictions\nabout the short term:\nThe health care building boom will wind down in\n2009.\nThe number of Americans without health insurance\nwill increase as the economy sheds jobs and employers look for ways to cut\ncosts. The ranks of the underinsured \u2014 people with bare-bones policies\nwith exclusions and high deductibles \u2014 will grow.\nInvestment in projects that might save\nmoney in the long run and make health care more efficient \u2014 electronic medical\nrecords, prevention programs, and the like \u2014 will be put off during the\nscramble to make ends meet.\nSo let\u2019s hope the\nshort term is just that, and that we are soon able to find the political skill\nand will to contain the costs of health care while also extending coverage to\n47 million uninsured Americans\n", "index": [[722, 727], [2518, 2526], [3671, 3673], [3933, 3946], [4230, 4249], [4728, 4732], [4737, 4748], [4908, 4916], [5181, 5219], [5512, 5523], [5693, 5697], [5888, 5892], [5958, 5962], [6522, 6529], [6531, 6540], [6542, 6547], [6549, 6555], [6737, 6745], [6829, 6844], [7075, 7080], [7117, 7124], [7212, 7218], [7239, 7242], [7645, 7648], [7942, 7976], [8025, 8028], [8146, 8149], [8311, 8314], [8394, 8397], [9147, 9156], [9792, 9801]], "wikipedia_ids": [1191951, 238097, 50982, 3434750, 6310, 7515928, 737, 3434750, 8168860, 8168860, 82974, 32087, 82974, 991203, 636957, 635659, 149612, 33589, 2870773, 14533, 5405, 14533, 11632, 32020972, 58920, 32020972, 32020972, 32020972, 32020972, 3434750, 3434750], "wikipedia_titles": ["Glycated hemoglobin", "Warfarin", "CT scan", "United States", "Columbia University", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "United States", "Walter Reed Army Institute of Research", "Walter Reed Army Institute of Research", "Post-traumatic stress disorder", "United States Army", "Post-traumatic stress disorder", "Alendronic acid", "Pravastatin", "Simvastatin", "Sertraline", "Walmart", "Medicare Part D", "India", "China", "India", "Food and Drug Administration", "Reinforcement sensitivity theory", "Washington University in St. Louis", "Reinforcement sensitivity theory", "Reinforcement sensitivity theory", "Reinforcement sensitivity theory", "Reinforcement sensitivity theory", "United States", "United States"]}

Box 14428,\nMelbourne 8001, Australia\nBecause of the effectiveness of modern stabilisers,\naccelerated ageing tests must be used to evaluate their\nperformance. Oven ageing testing is the most reliable but is time\nconsuming. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) has been\nwidely used for measuring oxidation induction times (OIT) but is\nusually (mis)used at temperatures above the melting point of the\npolymer.\nMany polymers emit light (chemiluminescence, CL) during\noxidation. CL offers an alternative method to monitor oxidation,\nits advantage being very high sensitivity. CL imaging of\noxidative degradation has recently been made possible by the\ndevelopment of low noise, high sensitivity cameras, which allow\nmultiple sampling, reducing experimental times and cost. Imaging\nalso allows study of inhomogeneity.\nIn collaboration with Mettler Toledo, we have combined CL\nmeasurement with DSC in a single instrument. The combination has\nobvious advantages where oxidation occurs simultaneously with\nother thermal events, e.g. melting, since the CL is sensitive\nonly to oxidation. CL in inert atmospheres can easily detect the\npresence of peroxides at concentrations well below those\ndetectable by DSC.\nMeasurements on unstabilised samples of polypropylene show\ngood correlation of CL with heat flow data, with kinetics\nconsistent with the Russell mechanism for CL. Studies of the\nformation of carbonyl groups show that the relation of CL to C=O\ncontent is also consistent with the Russell mechanism.\nFor stabilised samples OITs measured by both CL and DSC are\nsimilar. It is easier to operate the CL at very high sensitivity\nand CL can easily detect OITs above 70\u00a0h. Increased oxygen\npressures allow analysis by CL under conditions where DSC signals\nare noisy. There is good correlation between CL values measured\nby single-sample CL and imaging detection.\nMultiple detection needs some care in order to avoid cross\nsample contamination but allows major economy of equipment time.\nSome applications of the DSC/CL method will be discussed,\nincluding the assessment of stabiliser performance and the\ncorrelation of OIT and oven ageing.\nML02\nRADIATION AGEING OF POLYMER MATERIALS\nJ.L. GARDETTE, A. RIVATON\nLaboratoire de Photochimie Mol\u00e9culaire et Macromol\u00e9culaire,\nUMR CNRS 6505, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, 63177 Aubi\u00e8re cedex\nFrance\nThe modifications of structure and properties of polymeric\nmaterials resulting of the ageing initiated by ionising\nradiations have been a subject of interest as soon as nuclear\nprograms began. Exposure of polymers to radiative environments\ncauses indeed a deterioration of their properties. It has been\napproximately 50 years since researchers first began studying the\neffects of ionising radiations on polymers. The main\nradiation-induced changes consist in scissions and/or\ncrosslinking of the macromolecular chains, formation of gaseous\nproducts such as hydrogen or low molecular weight hydrocarbons,\naccumulation of oxidation products, loss and/or formation of\nunsaturations.\nAmong the numerous studies devoted to the radiochemical ageing\nof polymers, many of them report on the mechanism of the \uf067-initiated degradation of polyolefins.\nThis presentation concerns the behaviour of EPDM copolymers,\nwhich are composed of ethylene (PE), propylene (PP) and diene\nmonomer (5-ethylidene 2-norbornene (ENB) in this study). These\npolymers find numerous applications and are often used as wire\ninsulators or joints. If the mechanisms of photo- and\nthermo-oxidations of EPDM can be considered as well known, the\nradiation induced degradation of these polymers has only received\nlittle attention.\nOn the basis of a recent study involving the identification of\nthe various products that are formed, a mechanism accounting for\nthe radiochemical degradation of EPDM has been proposed, with a\npeculiar attention given to the role played by oxygen and by the\nENB termonomer. Two main processes are involved in the\nradiooxidation of EPDM. The random \uf067-radiolysis\nof the polymer provides a constant source of macroalkyl radicals\nmainly formed on ethylene units. The secondary radicals so formed\nare likely to initiate a selective oxidation of the polymer\nthrough free-radicals reactions involving the abstraction of\nlabile hydrogen atoms. In particular, the decomposition of\nhydroperoxydes and the degradation of the ENB moieties, this\nlatter being the most oxidisable site and the source of\ncrosslinking, may result from hydrogen abstraction by radicalar\nspecies.4\nML03\nOVERVIEW AND PARTICULARITIES IN DEGRADATION OF POLYOLEFINS\nDERIVED FROM FISCHER-TROPSCH SYNTHESIS\nI. TINCUL\nSasol Technology, PO Box 1, Sasolburg, 1947, South Africa\nPolyolefins are without doubt the largest volume family of\ncommercially polymers and a vast literature is dedicated to this\nfield in the last half of century. The most complex pool of\nmonomers is available from the Fischer Tropsch process that is\ngaining momentum as a major market source. When compared with\nethylene oligomerization processes the main advantage of the\nFischer Tropsch process is the production of odd carbon number\nlinear and branched olefins that showed new application\npossibilities in both the polyethylene and polypropylene\nfamilies. We prepared a large number of new polyolefins with\nFischer Tropsch derived alpha olefins that have particular\nmicrostructures and morphology according to the type of branch,\nlength of branch and number of branches / 1000 carbons.\nIt is known that steric factors may play an important role in\npolyolefin degradation and that tertiary carbon is labile to\noxidative attack. A decrease in crystallinity with the increase\nof comonomer content may favour auto-oxidation due to higher\noxygen absorbtion. Very little literature on degradation of\npolyolefins prepared with Fisher Tropsch derived olefins is\navailable. In this paper is presented and discussed some\nparticularities on the degradation of polyolefins Fischer Tropsch\nderived.\nThe manifestation of oxidation weather by temperature or aging\nconcerning polymer appearance as discoloration, loss of optical\nproperties, loss of mechanical properties and surface cracks were\nobserved. This behaviour was similar to known polyolefins.\nOxidation induction time as measured by DSC varies with the\nnumber of branch and length of branch introduced in the polymer\nchain by a certain comonomer. The thermal stability was measured\nalso by thermogravimetry and compared with the polymer structure\nand thermal behaviour. The degradation temperature increases with\nan increase of carbon number of the comonomer. Investigation for\na series of ethylene co-polymers and ter-polymers with linear and\nbranched alpha olefins showed an increase of pre-exponential\nfactor as a function of carbon number in an Arrhenius type\nequation. A decomposition kinetic study showed that the\nactivation and the rate constant is also related to the size and\ntype of branch. Rheological investigation showed a similar\npattern. It was concluded that while polyolefins obtained with\nFischer Tropsch derived olefins showed a behaviour similar with\nknown polyolefins, particularities in degradation does exist and\nare related to the number and type of branch.\nML04\nESSENTIAL CRITERIA FOR THE SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY OF PLASTICS\nN. MAYNE\nAssociation of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe, Avenue E. Van\nNieuwenhuyse 4, Box 3, B \u2013 1160 Brussels\nE-mail address: neil.mayne apme.org\nOf the many options for recovery of plastics at the\nend-of-life, mechanical recycling is in principle the preferred\nroute. There is an increasing understanding of the mechanisms,\nwhich affect the degradation of polymers or physical property\nenhancement by increasing their compatibility with other\npolymers. While many laboratory scale experiments demonstrate the\npotential for high levels of recycling, in practice the levels\nachieved on an industrial scale with post-consumer plastics can\nbe viewed as disappointingly low. In addition to economic\nconsiderations, this is because there are a limited number of\napplications allowing closed loop recycling and there is a\nmismatch between the supply of recyclate and demand from the\nmarket. New developments will increase the potential, but such\nrecycling will nevertheless remain limited.\nFeedstock recycling technologies offer versatility and many\nlarge scale processes have been developed and demonstrated.\nLogistics and supply commitments are key factors in determining\nviability. To date, fully commercial plants are only operational\nin Germany and Japan. A number of active developments are,\nhowever, currently underway in a number of European countries.\nEnergy recovery will become an increasingly important recovery\noption as it is also being stimulated by restrictions on the\nlandfilling of waste. Even if the full potential of mechanical\nrecycling were to be realized, the major part of total plastics\nwaste would still be available for use as an alternative fuel.\nThis means that with the expected growth of plastics, this\nrepresents an increasingly important source of energy, equivalent\nto millions of tonnes of imported oil each year.\nThe challenge for the successful recovery of plastics is to\nidentify and use the optimum combination of options, underpinned\nby continuing innovation in process, product and recovery\ntechnologies in order to increase the resource efficiency of\nproducts throughout their whole life-cycle.\nML05\nOPTIMISAZION OF PROCESSING CONDITIONS IN THE RECYCLING OF\nPOLYCONDENSATION POLYMERS\nF.P. LA MANTIA, R. SCAFFARO\nDipartimento di Ingegneria Chimica dei Processi e dei\nMateriali\nUniversit\u00e0 di Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128, Palermo,\nItaly\nMechanical recycling of polymers is a very complex and\ndifficult process because repetitive melt processing can lead to\nsevere degradation of these materials with subsequent\ndeterioration of all the properties. For condensation polymers,\nthe degradation rate is much faster in the presence of water that\ninduces depolymerization reactions, having also a synergistic\neffect with thermomechanical degradation and exalting the loss of\nproperties. Indeed, a careful drying prior to processing can\ndrastically reduce the degradation phenomena but increasing the\ncomplexity of the process and its cost.\nThe aim of this work is to study the effect of the\nreprocessing of some polycondensation polymers with and in\nabsence of water. Moreover, the possibility to process wet\npolymer in the presence of proper stabilisers to avoid the drying\nstep has been studied too.\nThe materials chosen for the study have been polyamide 6,\npolycarbonate and polyethyleneterephtalate.\nThe results indicate that for the three different systems\nconsidered, the wet processing causes, as expected, a strong\nreduction of the mechanical properties and of the molecular\nweight, as evidenced by rheological and thermal measurements.\nIf a degassing stage is added to the processing apparatus, a\ncertain improvement of the properties is observed. This can be\nexplained in terms of humidity removing with consequent reduction\nof the hydrolytic chain scission.\nWhen nitrogen flow is added to the degassing, both humidity\nand oxygen are practically eliminated from the system, and a\nfurther improvement of the properties is observed. This can be\nexplained with the further reduction of the humidity but it also\nsuggests that degradation mechanism involves reactions.\nThe presence small amounts (500 ppm) of a particular\nantioxidant has a positive effect in all the cases. In\nparticular, the adding of antioxidant can substitute the drying\nstage as it is able to protect the macromolecules from\nhydrolysis. This behaviour can be explained considering that this\nantioxidant is more prone to hydrolysis than the polymer, thus\nremoving the water from the melt and decreasing the degradation\nrate. Such consideration has been proved using different\nantioxidants with different tendency to hydrolysis: using\nantioxidants with theoretical reduced hydrolysis tendency caused\na parallel reduction of the protection with consequent loss of\nproperties.\nThe positive effect of the presence of the antioxidant has\nbeen also verified for several reprocessing steps (up to five).\nThe results indicate that the presence of the antioxidant still\nhave positive effects also after several recycling operation.\nIt can be concluded that the mechanical recycling of\ncondensation polymers can be effectuated with practically any\nloss of properties if an adequate removal of humidity from the\nsystem is performed. A valid alternative to the complex and\nexpensive pre-drying operation can be the adding of antioxidants\nthat undergo hydrolysis in vice of the polymers.\nML06\nFEEDSTOCK RECYCLING OF PLASTICS IN JAPAN\nA.OKUWAKI\nTohoku University, Graduate School of Environmental Studies,07\nAoba, Sendai, 980-8579\nVarious commercial plants for feedstock recycling of waste\nplastics have started up in Japan. In 1999, only Niigata\nliquefaction plant was operated. Now they are liquefaction at\nSapporo, and Mikasa, Blast Furnace application by NKK, Coke Oven\napplication by Nippon Steel Corp., Gasification by EBARA-UBE, and\nGlycolysis of PET bottles by Teijin. Separated PET bottles are\nnow used as raw material for polyester fibers, 30,000t/y in\ncapacity from April, 2002, and the two commercial plants for the\nBottle to Bottle recycling are under construction for the first\ntime in the world.\nClearly this is related to the practical implementation of the\nContainers and Packaging Recycling Law carried out in 1997 for\nPET bottles and in 2000 for the other plastics. This law affords\nallocating the cost for feedstock recycling of waste plastics\nseparated only in homes. It has created attractive markets and\nthus, they say that the separated waste plastics are even in\nshort supply in Japan. Recovery of PET bottles increases\nsuccessfully since 1997, but that of plastics increases\ndramatically since 2000 when the law has carried out.\nOn the other hand, their cost for recycling decreases\ngradually. At present, their recycling fees are quite expensive\ncompared to the cost for treatment of industrial waste plastics.\nHowever, it is expected that the cost will continue to drop. This\ntrend suggests that the active competitions among various\ntechniques proceed including the improvement of collection\nsystem. This situation creates big chances for the world\nrecycling technologies in the Japanese market and refine\nnecessarily both techniques and logistic systems.\nThe Home Appliances Recycling Law came into full force in\nApril 2001 is to be revised within a few years. In such process,\nthey say, not only the recycling of their plastics cases, but\nalso that of printed circuit boards are introduced to elevate the\nrecycling degree.\nIn addition, the Law for Recycling of End-of-Life Vehicles has\npassed through the Parliament, July 2002. They say, an average\ncost per car will be 20,000 Yen, namely 151Euro. Clearly this law\nshould proceed the recycling of automotive shredder residue.\nThese environmental policy of Japanese Government are sure to\npromote more the recycling of waste plastics in Japan\n", "index": [[568, 601], [603, 606], [801, 803], [823, 825], [920, 922], [1235, 1238], [1391, 1393], [1426, 1428], [1543, 1546], [1627, 1629], [1707, 1709], [1781, 1783], [1787, 1790], [1891, 1893], [1898, 1901], [1943, 1945], [1975, 1977], [2058, 2060], [2084, 2087], [2141, 2143], [2177, 2179], [2352, 2355], [2356, 2358], [3561, 3565], [3610, 3612], [3626, 3628], [3841, 3845], [6578, 6581], [8830, 8837], [8842, 8847], [8929, 8937], [13208, 13213], [13229, 13236], [13299, 13306], [13320, 13333], [13349, 13352], [13354, 13363], [13430, 13440], [13459, 13465], [14094, 14099], [14113, 14124], [14698, 14706], [15126, 15136], [15327, 15335], [15407, 15412]], "wikipedia_ids": [97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 158788, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 97914, 1543776, 77385, 201689, 1543776, 97914, 11867, 15573, 9239, 15573, 6793142, 6792879, 297203, 674796, 85342, 12644, 2369543, 15573, 292941, 15573, 13964, 15573, 15573], "wikipedia_titles": ["Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Carbonyl group", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "EPDM rubber", "Polyethylene", "Polypropylene", "EPDM rubber", "Differential scanning calorimetry", "Germany", "Japan", "Europe", "Japan", "Niigata (city)", "Sapporo", "Blast furnace", "JFE Holdings", "Coke (fuel)", "Glycolysis", "Teijin", "Japan", "Polyethylene terephthalate", "Japan", "Parliament of the United Kingdom", "Japan", "Japan"]}

Thank you, once again, for your participation!\nJenkins slips all the way to the 23rd spot after the Saints passed him up. (Photo Source)\nWith the twenty-third pick in the Canal Street Chronicles community mock draft, the ew England Patriots select...\nMalcolm Jenkins, CB, Ohio State\nHere at CSC, we are all familiar with Jenkins. He's been at the top of our draft boards for the past couple years. He's got the size and ability to succeed in the NFL. I don't feel the need to elaborate on that. We like him. We want him. But in case you forgot, diehardbermysaints made a\u00a0great FanPost\u00a0enumerating the 3 reasons to pick Jenkins.Some may argue LB is the Patriots most pressing need. However, with Maualuga and Cushing off the board, I don't believe the Pats should reach for Lauranitis, Matthews, or Sintim at this point. Each one of them would fill a nice need for the Pats; Lauranitis with the leadership, Matthews with the pass rush, and Sintim with the experience in the 3-4. Despite this, one of them should still be available when the Pats pick again at #34, making Jenkins a better value for this pick. Aside from that, a nucleus of Mayo and Adalius Thomas is still serviceable when surrounded by midlevel talent. I don't really see the Patriots going any other direction here. Their offense is solid. The top OL prospects are gone. Their pass rush and defensive line could use some work, but I think that need would be better fulfilled later this draft. So, this pick came to the man us Saints fans have longed for since Jason David first stepped on the field in black and gold. It's a damn shame I had to give him to the Patriots.\nThe Atlanta Falcons are now on the clock...\nCurrent Mock Draft\nPick\nTeam\nPlayer\nPosition\nCollege\nCSC Member\n#1\nDetroit Lions\nJason Smith\nOT\nBaylor\nMT_Always\n#2\nSt. Louis Rams\nMichael Crabtree\nWR\nTexas Tech\nDeuceisLoose926\n#3\nKansas City Chiefs\nAaron Curry\nLB\nWake Forest\nSatchmo26\n#4\nSeattle Seahawks\nEugene Monroe\nOT\nVirginia\nMobileSaint\n#5\nCleveland Browns\nBrian Orakpo\nDE\nTexas\nYESSaints\n#6\nCincinnati Bengals\nB.J.

Stanley Kubrick's 2001 was the first film to equate space travel and the spiritual sublime, with its enigmatic ages-of-man ending. It was followed by Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris which, though ostensibly set somewhere in the great beyond, was really an exploration of \"inner space\", of love, memory and a very Russian conception of the soul; Steven Soderbergh recently attempted an admirably quixotic remake. Other, more strictly generic science-fiction films have also explored an awareness that's not necessarily mystical as such, but certainly existential, depicting space travel as a condition of desolation and exile, and reminding us that it's awfully big and cold out there: notably, John Carpenter's Dark Star, and Douglas Trumbull's prescient eco-drama Silent Running. Now there's a British attempt at transcendental sci-fi: Danny Boyle's Sunshine, scripted by novelist Alex Garland, his collaborator on 28 Days Later\u2026 The one-line premise: set the controls for the heart of the sun. Fifty years hence, the sun is dying, and a spaceship loaded with explosives has headed out from Earth in a last-ditch attempt to reboot the failing star. The vessel, somewhat recklessly, has been named Icarus. The name is symbolic not just for the mission, but for the film, as if to signal that Boyle and Garland are also working with impossibly high stakes: plucky Brits taking on a big-scale genre project, an undertaking so ambitious that they too risk getting their wings fried. All in all, the film-makers emerge with pinions intact: I don't suppose James Cameron or Michael Bay will feel very threatened, but that's not the point. Narratively, Sunshine barely convinces, but it does lay on an arresting CGI light show. Early on, one of the astronauts takes an unguarded look at the sun, a revitalising \"shower in light\", even though Icarus (the name of the ship's talking computer as well as the vessel itself) warns of \"irreversible damage to the retinas.\" You may well worry about your own retinas, as we're constantly blasted by intense light of assorted digital textures: up close, the sun is a writhing, rustling field of flame, the universe's biggest, trippiest lava lamp. Director of photography Alvin Kuchler also explores light in more subtly dazzling ways: dust motes swim in a green haze; an extreme close-up of an eye reflects colour like a Christmas bauble. As in Minority Report, translucent graphics hang shimmering in the air; in the snappiest piece of illusionism, the ship's \"Earth Room\" displays 3D images of the Old Planet, with a forest on one wall and an ocean splashing on another. The camera hangs rapturously on gleaming golden surfaces, such as the bulbous spacesuits, and an umbrella-like canopy made of a million shifting leaves. But all this can be overpowering, and it comes as a welcome relief when the film plunges us into the dark, as the astronauts explore a dead, dust-filled spaceship. Not only do our eyes get a rest, but Sunshine's brash hyper-modernity also takes a breather, as it veers into old-fashioned adventure. Entering the ghost ship, one character jokes, \"We might get picked off one by one by aliens.\" Perhaps this line represents a moment of self-conscious decadence in the genre: a science-fiction film in which the characters have watched Alien. Sunshine certainly knows its antecedents and doesn't attempt to hide its debt. The voice of Icarus is a female cousin to 2001's HAL, even shifting down a couple of octaves, like his, in a moment of crisis. The spaceship's oxygen-making mini-rainforest also echoes Silent Running. But you do get a disturbing sense of a genre having run out of new narrative ideas: you feel the film is less about the last gasp of the sun, than that of space-travel cinema itself. Despite its dreamy beginnings, much of the film opts traditionally for action rather than awe. Malfunctions pile up, human errors get made, crisis follows nail-biting crisis. But there's so little going on in terms of character that you barely care when terrible fates befall the crew members. Rose Byrne, Benedict Wong, Michelle Yeoh and Hiroyuki Sanada offer different degrees of tight-jawed determination, but we never really know who they are. The only character touches that really signify are somewhat crude: one person makes a noble sacrifice, another loses nerve, and there's a clash between two young bucks, played by Cillian Murphy (left) and the American actor Chris Evans. Sunshine's religious dimension explicitly re-emerges when the mission's success is endangered by a fanatic who's been out in space too long and wants to be \"alone with God.\" The presence of the Sublime is signalled in the finale by juddering discontinuity in the editing, and an image stretched as though the projectionist had suddenly switched lenses. The presence of the Almighty, or just an almighty headache? Decide for yourself. I can't help feeling that a simple burning bush might have been more affecting than this all-out forest fire. Like their astronauts, Boyle and Garland are on a mission: to prove that a big, bold, intelligent, UK-made space epic is feasible. They've succeeded, up to a point: Sunshine\n", "index": [[694, 709], [844, 860], [863, 870], [1002, 1009], [1034, 1051], [1383, 1397], [1400, 1409], [1415, 1431], [1454, 1468], [1484, 1491], [1526, 1537], [1540, 1548], [1571, 1583], [1781, 1786], [1981, 1986], [1991, 1998], [2241, 2254], [2258, 2269], [2336, 2344], [2395, 2398], [3045, 3054], [3069, 3084], [3651, 3659], [3983, 3988], [3990, 3998], [4118, 4121], [4254, 4268], [4747, 4757], [4759, 4772], [4774, 4787], [4792, 4807], [5080, 5094], [5110, 5118], [5125, 5136], [5138, 5146], [5306, 5309], [5511, 5519], [5705, 5710], [5715, 5722], [5781, 5783], [5847, 5855]], "wikipedia_ids": [26683, 676, 20181213, 25391, 27337, 52260, 1858763, 1082915, 539816, 31717, 105439, 3252860, 285613, 9228, 105439, 285613, 15622, 568801, 3252860, 31626763, 6237, 142049, 3252860, 23487440, 3252860, 14384, 539816, 854487, 5715238, 147873, 1031626, 481634, 3434750, 1535704, 3252860, 5042765, 237303, 105439, 285613, 31717, 3252860], "wikipedia_titles": ["Stanley Kubrick", "Andrei Tarkovsky", "Solaris (1972 film)", "Russia", "Steven Soderbergh", "John Carpenter", "Dark Star (film)", "Douglas Trumbull", "Silent Running", "United Kingdom", "Danny Boyle", "Sunshine (2007 film)", "Alex Garland", "Earth", "Danny Boyle", "Alex Garland", "James Cameron", "Michael Bay", "Sunshine (2007 film)", "Computer-generated imagery", "Christmas", "Minority Report (film)", "Sunshine (2007 film)", "Alien (film)", "Sunshine (2007 film)", "HAL 9000", "Silent Running", "Rose Byrne", "Benedict Wong", "Michelle Yeoh", "Hiroyuki Sanada", "Cillian Murphy", "United States", "Chris Evans (actor)", "Sunshine (2007 film)", "God", "Bruce Almighty", "Danny Boyle", "Alex Garland", "United Kingdom", "Sunshine (2007 film)"]}

During the day, volunteer hosts interacted with students in a two-way dialogue, leading to sharing career aspirations by students and career experience by the host. In addition, the volunteer hosts, who acted as role models, offered valuable career guidance as they gave students real-life insight and first-hand experience into the corporate world.\"It was invigorating while interacting with bright, young, enthusiastic Emiratis,\" said Lata Swaminathan, Vice President, Acquisitions & Marketing, Middle East, Citibank, NRI Business, Dubai.The Job Shadow Day primarily focuses on developing students' work-readiness skills that prepares them for the modern world of work.

The program also enables youth to become knowledgeable about a wider range of career avenues and an array of social and personal aspects that impact their career choices and future goals.Expressing her satisfaction with the experience, EramAsghar Mohammad had spent her Job Shadow Day in the HR Department and attended a real interview. She commented \"The interviewee lacked confidence and basic work readiness skills that we had been taught in the classroom; therefore, it was a no hire for me.\" The programme takes youth out of their school day and everyday environment to expose them to jobs and introduce them to role models who can help them plan for their future.

Already harsh words are being\nexchanged between EU institutions, one of the last realms of diplomatic\nkindness. \"The violation of EU legislation is continuing and with it the\nrights of European citizens are being violated.\" This judgement from an\nofficial Working Document of the European Parliament is aimed at the\nCommission, which, according to the document, \"in the 6 months since the\nadoption of Parliament's resolution (on the transfer of Airline\nPassenger's PNR data to US authorities) has made very little progress\nwith regard to ensuring that EU data protection legislation is observed\".\nStill, the EP rapporteur, Dutch Liberal Johanna Boogerd-Quaak, continues,\n\"Your rapporteur believes that the US commitments do not offer adequate\nprotection.\" \"This\", she concludes, \"is a flagrant violation of EU data\nprotection legislation, as laid down in Directive 95/46 EC and Regulation\n2299/89.\" Members of Parliament are now ready to prepare two oral\nquestions for the Council and the Commission, and eventually take legal\naction before the European Court of Justice.\nOn 13 March, the Parliament passed a resolution containing criticism of\nthe Commission's secretive negotiations with US envoys about the\ntransfer of airline passenger's personal data to the United States.\nParliament was angry about the lack of adequate level of data protection.\nIt urged the Commission to ensure that EU Privacy and Data Protection law\nwould be respected. Up to the present day that is not the case. The\nprocedure that might now follow is laid down in Article 232 of the EC Treaty. First an official warning by the Parliament. Next, action before\nthe Strasbourg court that could result in the Commission being obliged to\nstop the transfer immediately. Already on 2 September, the Chair of the EP\nCivil Liberties Committee has taken first steps to prepare such action.\nThis is also what the Parliament will urge now: a prohibition of all data\ntransfer on a 'pull' basis by 1 October, and an international agreement\nthat will have to be in accordance with EU data protection law. In her\nWorking Paper, Mrs. Boogerd-Quaak goes into some detail and exemplifies\nminimum requirements any future arrangement should meet to avoid legal\naction, such as reducing the storage time from 7 years to the duration of\nthe passenger's stay in the US and reconsidering whether PNR transfer is\nadequate in the proclaimed fight against terrorism.\nOn 5 May EDRi launched a campaign against the PNR transfer, with letters\npassengers can send to the national Data Protection Authority in their\ncountry to request an investigation of the illegal transfer of their\npersonal data.\nEP draft Oral Question to the Council (02.09.2003)\nhttp://www.europarl.eu.int/meetdocs/committees/libe/20030908/505934en....\nWorking Document Johanna L.A.

This small quaint settlement is located at\nthe mouth of the San Juan River and Port San Juan. Port Renfrew\nis the southeast end of the Pacific Rim National Park's West Coast Trail. This trail is a 77km (45.5mi) hike along the coast of Vancouver Island. This is typically west coast, with wet weather and lush\nforests. This whole area is heaven to hikers, hunters, anglers\nand beachcombers. When in this area , take in the Botanical Beach\nProvincial Park. Go at low tide, to see the intertidal life. It's\nalso a good place to view the Pacific grey whales. And by taking\nlogging roads from Port Renfrew you can travel to Cowichan Lake.\nClick\nhere for a list of accommodation/adventure providers in this area.\nLake Cowichan:\nNorth\nof Duncan, take Hwy 18 to Lake Cowichan. This long partially paved\nroad cuts through from the east to the middle of the island and\nbeyond to the west coast. Lake Cowichan has excellent trout fishing,\nFrom Lake Cowichan Village at the east end of the lake, the road\nsplits. The road along the north shore leads to Yoobou and a logging\nroad to Bamfield. The south shore road leads to Port Renfrew.\nAround Lake Cowichan's shore is a network of nature walks. The\nCowichan Valley Demonstration Forest , located along the lake,\non Hwy 18, provides an outdoor classroom of forest management.\nClick\nhere for a list of accommodation/adventure providers in this area.\nLadysmith:\nLadysmith\nis 85km (53mi) north of Victoria on Hwy 1. It was the home for\ncoal miners who worked the Extension Mines and draws it's name\nfrom Ladysmith, South Africa.

With the help of local artists , it became \"Canada's\nlargest outdoor art gallery\". The 32 large murals,\npainted on downtown walls, depicting the history of the area,\nare more than just a local attraction. It's said that over 250,000\npeople from far and wide come to see these murals. The tourist\ntrade has given Chemainus the economic jolt it needed.\nClick\nhere for a list of accommodation/adventure providers in this area.\nBamfield\nThis\nout-of-the-way salmon fishing centre is on the southeast side\nof Barclay Sound. During the summer the population increases from\n275 to about 2,000 people, as sports fishermen use it as a base\nto fish Barclay Sound and Alberni Inlet. Many others come to hike,\nscuba dive and canoe. This small community is well equipped to\nhandle the increased population during the summer.

{"id": "clueweb12-0503wb-70-07956", "bracket": "0.9-1.0", "text": "Editorial - July, 1996\nLetter from the Editor(July, 1996)\nIts hard to believe it but two years have come and gone since the\nfirst issue of the Game Cabinet hit the Web. In that time, there have\nbeen twenty-three monthly issues - I missed the April issue of this\nyear - with over 500 articles. I feel like I should thank lots of people\nindividually but the last time I tried that I left out poor Stuart!\nSo a special thanks to Stuart Dagger and, of course, Mike Siggins\nand Catherine Soubeyrand who have been great about helping out whenever\nI needed them. All of the Cabinet Makers have added their own bit of\nscrollwork here or a new shelf there. Without them, the whole wouldn't\nhave been as exciting. I hope we can all make it another two years!\nThanks, again, folks!\nAs an aside, Mike Sanderson\nbrought us the whizzy birthday cakes appearing on this month's cover.\nThanks, Mike! By the way, Mike hates endless loops, too, but it is a\nbirthday so a certain amount of fuss was appropriate.\nThe German Invasion: American Phase\nThis Summer we are witnessing the beginning of a German invasion of America.\nMayfair has released a line of five new\nGerman imports, including many Spiel des Jahres winners from the past\nfew years. Winning Moves has released Raj, an American edition of Hol's\nder Geier, an interesting little card game (though I must admit that\nI would be tempted to use the bits to play High Society, instead).\n6 Nimmt has been released as Take 6. And there are more to follow.\nThe Mayfair series looks quite good. I could quibble about some of\nthe production choices. I'm not a huge fan of their use of photography\nin place of paintings or drawings as in Settlers of Cattan. And I think\nleaving the card colors off of the board for Modern Art is a bit of\na game play faux pax. But the simple fact is that all of the games in\nthe new line are produced to a higher standard than we have become\naccustomed to here in the States. And the prices have been kept in\nline with or even lower than those we are accustomed to paying. Mayfair\nhas done an excellent job and they've certainly earned the point position\non all subsequent import editions.\nWinning Moves has made a mixed start out of the gate. Raj and Priceless\nare certainly of interest. But the rest of the line seems to be marketed\nat the Victorian Parlour Game crowd.\nWhat's in a Name?\nWhich reminds me: there has been a running discussion in Sumo as to\nwhat term should be used to refer to the sorts of games that are covered\nin The Game Cabinet, Sumo, and The Game Report. Clearly, some of the games\nfall into the category of Victorian Parlor Games. Taboo, TriBond, TalkSHOW, and\nfriends descend from that tradition. But most of the games are fairly\nnew and original both in form and substance. Collectable card games\nalong with the works of Knizia, Sackson, Teuber, and others define a\nnew genre (or genres) of games for which we have no easy label.\nMy suggestion (boy, I can really feel 'em flappin' in the wind now, boys):\nCafe Games. These games tend to be short in duration - 1 to 1.5 hours tops.\nThey're appearance is striking and, ideally, even beautiful. The individual\ncomponents are of high quality - durable cards from Belgium, simple pieces made\nof wood, more sculpted pieces made of bright, durable plastic, boards mounted\non heavy cardboard with waterproof coatings. The game play is dynamic and\nengaging with all of the players active as much of the time as possible.\nThe social aspects are strong as players interact and have a good time.\nAnd the games appeal to a broad range of people - not just the fanboys\nand the spielfreaks.\nThe Rumor Monger\nI'm curious about ElfenWars, an obscure Alan Moon design mentioned in\nthis month's Sumo. Anyone know anything more about it? Apparently copies\nhave been changing hands at outrageous prices.\nThe Ravensburger/FX Schmid merger continues. Apparently, FX Schmid will be\nusing the Ravensburger production facilities for boards, boxes, and the\nlike while Ravensburger will be using FX Schmid's card production. So we\ncan look for even higher quality editions from both companies! The plan\nfor now is to operate both design groups separately. This seems like a\nwise decision as Ravensburger is strongest in children's games while\nFX Schmid is strongest with adult and family games.\nInside the Cabinet\nDon't forget to check out Charles Vasey's article on\nChaos Gaming.

A country\u2019 s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.\u201d\nHe said that in 1994, though writing in 2010 he might have put these points differently. In the short- run, productivity does little to solve what is a balance-sheet recession, though in the long run it\u2019 s nearly everything. A country\u2019 s ability to pay back its debts while minimizing the fall in its standard of living depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.\nProductivity is once again moving centre stage. If the sovereign debt crisis had one clear positive it was the focus it started to place on growth prospects going forward. Of course in the short run, the sheer scale of retrenchment which Ireland is being forced into will result in a weaker growth than would have otherwise been the case. However as we move beyond this, productivity growth will again take over as the primary driver of welfare.\nThis is where the Smart Economy debate, long derided as a wordy PR distraction, will increase in relevance. What\u2019 s disappointing about this debate is that up to now it has focused almost entirely on exporting firms, the one section of the economy that is already demonstrably smart.\nThe evidence of this is striking. In a research paper published in October, the ECB ranked Ireland as being the most high-tech exporting country, far outpacing Austria and Finland in second and third place respectively. The other countries with which we supposedly share so many similarities, namely Greece and Spain, were at the opposite end of the scale. In the space of twenty years Ireland has moved to the quality end of the export spectrum, and is a world leader in pharmaceuticals, information technology and services.\nHowever the debate on how we can make our exporting sector smarter has continued in what is an increasingly redundant debate. Many of these issues have been resolved a long time ago. Should we or shouldn\u2019 t have an active industrial policy? Answer: We should and we do. Should we turn our back on services, and concentrate on manufacturing? Answer: No we shouldn\u2019t, nor will we.\nWhy then do policymakers still focus on exporters? The reason is simple. Productivity growth destroys as it creates. Improving productivity requires out-dated practices to be swept away, companies to transform and workers to re-skill. It\u2019s difficult, often unpopular, yet crucial for long-run economic health.\nHowever when we create an exporting operation in Ireland, the pain is felt elsewhere. Maybe a plant gets shut in Israel, or a planned expansion in the US is cancelled. Do you think that when the Polish Government was pitching to Dell that it was worried about the job losses in Limerick? Of course not. Promoting export firms is a one-way bet, and avoids having to make the really difficult decisions.\nWhat our exporters really need now is action to reduce the cost of operating a business from Ireland.\nThe source of this cost is the sectors which sell into the domestic market, many of whom are anything but smart. This is not just another jab at the public sector. Many sectors dominated by private provision in Ireland remain unreformed, inefficient and expensive.\nReforming these sectors will be difficult, and the benefits aren\u2019 t immediate. Reform must be done sector by sector, ensuring that regulation promotes competition. The Government itself must become a very demanding customer for local services through its procurement practices.\nThe banking sector is a case in point. Banks are the gatekeepers for Ireland\u2019 s payments industry, the means by which we as a society pay for goods and services. Almost uniquely in Europe, the Irish payments industry remains dominated by paper \u2013 i.e. cash and cheques - at a cost of \u20ac1bn annually to the economy.\nThe cost of our high use of cash and cheques goes beyond pure financial concerns. Wide-scale cash usage helps perpetuate the shadow economy, at a considerable cost to ordinary, compliant taxpayers. Further, the security challenges of transporting large volumes of cash are needlessly putting the lives of bank, retail and security staff at risk. Finally, there is a strong correlation between a country\u2019 s use of cheques and the problem of a late payments culture, which in Ireland causes huge difficulties for SMEs.\nOf course the payments issue is just one example of many. The recent Forf\u00e1s report, \u201cMaking it Happen, Growing Enterprise for Ireland\u201d, sets out the range of actions needed to stimulate domestic productivity. It highlights the role of competition policy, particularly in the areas of legal and medical services, where costs remain very high despite the price falls in the rest of the economy. They also highlight public procurement as an area which needs to be overhauled. Firms react to the demands of consumers, and where the Government is the consumer it has to become far more demanding.\nWe are not alone in this need to tackle structural reforms. The above ECB report concluded that European policymakers have been using the strength of the Euro as an excuse for Europe\n", "index": [[930, 941], [950, 962], [1825, 1832], [2097, 2099], [2397, 2400], [2408, 2415], [2477, 2484], [2489, 2496], [2617, 2623], [2628, 2633], [2703, 2710], [3581, 3588], [3645, 3651], [3683, 3685], [3727, 3733], [3761, 3765], [3810, 3818], [4027, 4034], [4247, 4254], [4648, 4655], [4760, 4766], [4772, 4777], [5366, 5373], [5403, 5407], [5535, 5542], [5937, 5947], [6071, 6074], [6097, 6105], [6155, 6159], [6177, 6183]], "wikipedia_ids": [21201, 313701, 14560, 24389, 9474, 14560, 26964606, 10577, 12108, 26667, 14560, 14560, 9282173, 3434750, 22936, 102490, 56885, 14560, 14560, 14560, 9239, 14560, 14560, 426334, 14560, 12229, 9474, 9239, 9472, 9239], "wikipedia_titles": ["Nobel Prize", "Paul Krugman", "Republic of Ireland", "Public relations", "European Central Bank", "Republic of Ireland", "Austria", "Finland", "Greece", "Spain", "Republic of Ireland", "Republic of Ireland", "Israel", "United States", "Poland", "Dell", "Limerick", "Republic of Ireland", "Republic of Ireland", "Republic of Ireland", "Europe", "Republic of Ireland", "Republic of Ireland", "Small and medium-sized enterprises", "Republic of Ireland", "Government", "European Central Bank", "Europe", "Euro", "Europe"]}

However, it was a\ndifficult week for the ladies as Dionne Warwick and Dionne Warwick\ncontinuously butted heads with project manager Lisa Rinna.\nThis week's task was to create a children's book and perform it in\nfront of an audience of kids. The teams were judged on originality,\npresentation and age appropriateness. From start to finish, it was an\nexciting two hours of television. Check out three moments that kept us\nchuckling and glued to the TV...\nLa Toya, the Lion\nFor nearly a half an hour, Team ASAP deliberated and battled over the\ntheme and direction of the children's book they were creating. Lisa Rinna failed to delegate and lead the ladies \u2014 which we knew would be\nhard, given their personalities. After battling back and forth about whether or not the\nchildren's book would take on a deaf theme from castmate Marlee Matlin,\nthe team collectively decided Dionne Warwick's idea of a lion developing the courage to be himself was best. La Toya Jackson was voted to be the lion and\nshe made an impressive roar during the performance, complete with a\nblond mane. But it wasn't enough to impress\nguest judge Holly Robinson Peete.\nStar Steals the Show\nDuring the process of putting together the book, Jones recognizes\nRinna's weakness as a leader and seemingly can't help herself from taking control. Star\nsteps up to the plate and writes the children's book with the help of\nNeNe Leakes while the team goes out to finish gathering props for the show.\nWhen the group meets at the end to finalize plans, Jones brings up that\nshe wants her name on the book which causes a dispute amongst the team. Warwick soon jumps into the fight and says she deserves credit\ntoo for coming up with the idea. SMH.\nC'mon ladies, it's a team effort \u2014 enough of the diva antics. Everyone\nsurely participated in the project whether or not each idea was used. To see the ladies duke it out and not come to a concensus while\nthe men sailed through the process was agonizing.\nBoardroom Brawl\nWhen it was all said and done, the ladies lost to team Backbone. Rinna dragged both Jones and Warwick to the boardroom for\nelimination. Mr. Trump pointed out that the main reasons the ladies\nfailed at the challenge was because of the book's idea not being\noriginal, thanks to Warwick, and the book not being age-appropriate,\nthanks to Jones. However, the fierce and bold Jones threw Rinna under the bus and let\nit be known that she didn't do a good job as project manager. She\nexplained that Rinna had lots to learn and \"Celebrity Apprentice\"\nwasn't the place to learn those skills. Rinna was eliminated after\nTrump sided with Jones and Warwick.\nOne thing is apparent,after watching last night's episode, the Black\nwomen on this show are tough! They're about their business. The other\nladies should beware and step up their game if they want to last. Go Star, Dionne, NeNe and Le Toya for a job well done \u2014 even though you lost the challenge.\nWe're looking forward to next week's episode where the teams go\ncamping. Can't picture these high maintenance women in the wilderness\n\u2014 but we'll be tuning in with a bag of popcorn.In your opinion, who should have been eliminated this week?\nRelated Stories\n'Celebrity Apprentice' Season Premiere Recap NeNe Lashes Out at 'Apprentice' Castmate, Star Jones Have Star Jones and NeNe Leakes Called a Truce?

Despite having a world famous performer in the family, Cliff didn\u2019t sing during the wedding service or the reception.\nCliff, who boasts a massive 27 million single sale in the UK alone, dressed up especially for the occasion in a purple tinted suit and shoes to match the Maroon wedding car, and completed the look with a bight fuchsia flower in his button hole.\nAccording to reports, Sir Cliff kept a low profile throughout the day, not wanting to detract for his niece\u2019s special day.

PAUL, Minn. - The Golden Bear women's basketball team has jumped out to a great start this season, 6-0 overall and 2-0 in NSIC play and can build a true name for themselves this weekend.\u00a0 They head out on the road for games against Minnesota, Crookston (3-4, 1-1 NSIC) and an undefeated MSU Moorhead\u00a0squad this Friday and Saturday, with tip-off times of 6:00 pm both nights.\u00a0 This is the last NSIC action of the 2009 calendar year, with three non-conference games scheduled over the holidays.\u00a0 VIEW COMPLETE RELEASE\u00a0 -\u00a0 WATCH LIVE\u00a0 -\u00a0 LIVE STATS\nConcordia will have to be focused and prepared for both games this weekend.\u00a0 Minnesota, Crookston is a different team than they have been in the past, taking a non-conference win from Winona State, a league win over Bemidji State and forcing Minnesota Duluth into an overtime period.\u00a0 They have been able to put up plenty of points, but the Golden Bears hope their fast offense will overpower UMC's defense.\nMSU Moorhead is neck-and-neck with Concordia in receiving points for the national poll but not yet taking in a top-25 ranking.\u00a0 Both squads will aim to keep their season undefeated on Saturday night.\u00a0 The Dragons look much different than the Golden Bears, with the majority of their scoring and defense coming from post players.\u00a0 CU and MSUM are the NSIC's two leading points-scorers, the Golden Bears using speed and guards to score and\u00a0the Dragons bumping and forcing their hand down low with their bigs.\u00a0 MSUM leads the NSIC in rebounding and has used shot blocking to stifle opponent shooting, limiting them to 30.1%.\u00a0 Concordia hopes to attack MSUM before they have a chance to use their posts, expecting a full court press and on-ball pressure to take the advantage in the game.\nGuard Jineen Williams (Jr., Racine, Wis.) is the top averaging scorer for Concordia\u00a0so far this season.\u00a0 She averaged 18.0 points and 4.5 rebounds per game while shooting 50% from the field last weekend and has a team high 16.7 ppg this year.\u00a0 Guard Maurika Hickman (Jr., Minneapolis, Minn.) has also had a strong few weeks, now averaging 13.8 ppg.\u00a0 Jamie Jones (Sr., Mounds View, Minn.), also a guard, is\u00a0the team's third-leading scorer with 12.3 ppg.\u00a0 Jones\n", "index": [[1639, 1648], [1716, 1725], [1727, 1736], [1823, 1835], [1855, 1868], [1881, 1890], [1891, 1897], [1980, 1992], [2082, 2091], [2252, 2259], [2289, 2301], [2377, 2379], [2384, 2388], [2397, 2401], [2436, 2448], [2489, 2496], [2555, 2559], [2570, 2574], [2670, 2679], [2696, 2700], [2855, 2858], [2860, 2866], [2868, 2871], [2906, 2915], [3099, 3102], [3104, 3115], [3117, 3121], [3182, 3193], [3195, 3198], [3200, 3211], [3213, 3217], [3286, 3291]], "wikipedia_ids": [382361, 19590, 1984886, 624207, 770313, 19590, 63503, 20082815, 382361, 4286852, 20082815, 223219, 624201, 79697, 20082815, 4286852, 624201, 79697, 382361, 624201, 167656, 90941, 920425, 382361, 167656, 6097240, 19590, 16275569, 24069615, 124578, 19590, 4176746], "wikipedia_titles": ["Concordia Stingers", "Minnesota", "University of Minnesota Crookston", "Winona State University", "Bemidji State University", "Minnesota", "Duluth, Minnesota", "Kutztown Golden Bears", "Concordia Stingers", "St. George Illawarra Dragons", "Kutztown Golden Bears", "University of Colorado", "Minnesota State University Moorhead", "Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference", "Kutztown Golden Bears", "St. George Illawarra Dragons", "Minnesota State University Moorhead", "Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference", "Concordia Stingers", "Minnesota State University Moorhead", "Sal Mineo", "Racine County, Wisconsin", "Wis", "Concordia Stingers", "Sal Mineo", "Minneapolis", "Minnesota", "Jamie Jones (snooker player)", "Senior (education)", "Mounds View, Minnesota", "Minnesota", "Brad Jones (soccer)"]}

If you wish to experience the words of the famous poet, pick up your bag, put on your walking shoes and set out towards Langtang National Park. The pristine forest, the clear rivers, waterfalls and lakes, the colourful flowers, wildlife and birds, make every step you take worth while. Add to this the food, the local drinks, the music and cultural dances, the monasteries and the chortens and you will forget the effort you put in to get to these amazing sites. It is also a perfect venue to launch the \u201cacademic trek\u201d in which people can get a real exposure to climate change, its impact, adaptation strategies and mitigation measures. Portions of the trail we walked on could be part of the proposed Great Himalayan Trail (GHT) that has been designed not just as a tourism product but will serve to provide connectivity for all settlements at the foothills of the Himalayas. It will form an integral part of Nepal\u2019s adaptation plan against climate change.\nAll renewables- solar and hydro\nAt each of the lodges and tea houses that we had our meals or spent the night, there was either solar power or clean hydro power. The area is fortunate to have three hydro power plants- Devighat, Trishuli and the Chilime with potential for many more. The world is today putting out ninety million tones of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each day. Under normal conditions, the atmosphere should contain only 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide, but today has reached 387.\u00a0 Rasuwa district can easily become renewable energy self sufficient and \u2018sell\u2019 the surplus to Kathmandu and launch a domestic carbon trade mechanism. As it takes a lot of human effort to move goods up and down the slopes of Rasuwa, electricity powered ropeways can be a real possibility here. Biogas plants are also getting popular in the villages in the south of the district.\nRed, white and blue\nEach day we saw red and white rhododendron flowers along the trail against the clear blue sky. It did rain and it did snow, but it cleared up quickly to give us spectacular views of the flora and landscape of the area. Red, white and blue are the colors that make up the Nepali national flag and it is Nepal Tourism year. We all carried the flag, sticking out of each of our backpacks as we climbed up and walked down the slopes of the Himalayas. Recently there has been some debate as to whether we should change the flag. As you walk through Langtang, the blue becomes the sky and the numerous rivers, the white becomes the purity of the glaciers and the rhododendron, the red is the rhododendron and the blood of the entrepreneurial spirit of the people; and as long as the sun and moon comes up each day over the ridge to the east, this country will be there. The first night of our trek, we were greeted by a full moon.\u00a0 Red, blue and white also make up the flag of the USA whose 60 years in Nepal we were celebrating.\nClimate change\nThe theme of the trek was to observe the impact of climate change and to see what efforts were underway to help and enable local people to adapt to these changes. We all had mixed feelings at the end of the trek. On the one hand climate change and its effects were real. We heard of changing rainfall patterns to new species of plants that were killing local livestock. We were told about change in habitat for local endangered species of flora and fauna and the unreliability of water supplies from traditional sources. A local woman had even composed a poem about climate change. What was really heart warming was to see how local communities had begun to create a seed bank to protect local gene varieties of crops. We saw how renewable energy sources were being harnessed to reduce pressure on the local forest such as biogas. We were delighted to see so much production of \u2018organic\u2019 food and to meet young people who were well educated about the complexity of climate change.\nTrout and strawberry\nRural Nepali villages, are not just about maize and soybeans or millet and buckwheat anymore, but have created good food out of local stingy nettle or \u201csisnoo.\u201d When prepared and served in style, the local dish can be quite a delight. Further, it is also a pleasant surprise to see so many framers have begun strawberry farming in the area. Others are big into the Himalayan Rainbow Trout farming. The people are so enterprising and will do well against all odds. One does see \u201cready made noodles\u201d of different brands everywhere along with carbonated drinks. We do not need to do much except give the trekker a choice and educate them about the value creation in the local economy if we eat local food. The milk and the cheese of the local areas are of really good quality. Everywhere we also had yogurt, alcoholic drinks made from locally grown millet which were offered as a welcome gesture in silver decorated cups and served from traditional decanters.\n60 years and 50 years\nThe people of the United States of America have been helping the people of Nepal for sixty years now. The US Agency for International Development USAID has helped so many Nepalis to acquire higher education and various trainings. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has been helping protect Nepal\u2019s globally unique flora and fauna for fifty years. The green hike, green planet trek was part of these anniversary celebrations. The American people have given so much to Nepal including highways, higher education institutes, ropeways, and so much more.\u00a0 WWF has helped Nepal become a global leader in conservation of rich flora and fauna. Both deserve our gratitude and commitment to do more for ourselves as Nepalis. We need to take ownership of our challenges and begin to become proactive. Climate change, adaptation and mitigation could very well be an area where Nepal could take the lead. We watched the final game of a local volleyball tournament and gave away the WWF sponsored Red Panda Trophy and medals to the winning team!\nRasuwa Gaddi to Galchi\nThe trade volume between India and China in 2008 had exceeded a value of US $ 50 billion. The question that many ask is, can this go through Nepal? We do need to be organized if Nepal is going to take advantage of this instead of just a handful of \u201cclever people\u201d as in the past. The Rasuwa Gaddhi to Galchi highway is nearing completion with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We drove back along this road and began a conversation centered around how this may serve as a green corridor between Nepal and Tibet, China that will enhance conservation and management of natural resources. Local people in Rasuwa aspire to send fresh \u201corganic\u201d food each day into Tibet. There is talk of a \u201cgreen special economic zone\u201d in the area as well. We have to make sure that illegal wildlife body parts do not travel on this road. We must also ensure that the \u201cclean\u201d river that currently flows along the highway does not suffer the same fate as others in the past.\nJust do it\nLangtang is waiting for you. There cannot be an excuse not to go enjoy and pamper yourself. It is a good place to mix work and holiday as well. Over the next weeks and months, many pilgrims will be going up to Gosaikunda.

It\u2019s disappointing and unfortunate that we have to deal with this in the middle of the season. \u201cIt is what it is, so right now as a team we have to focus on the things we can control, and we have a very challenging game here against a very talented opponent in Florida. We have to get ready to play the game.\u201dGrant suspended Green, Releford and Steele indefinitely just before Saturday\u2019s loss at LSU for violating team rules, sending them packing for Tuscaloosa before tipoff.That was also the second game of Mitchell\u2019s suspension.The disciplinary actions left the Tide (16-8, 5-5 Southeastern Conference) without players responsible for 69 percent of its scoring, 57 percent of rebounding and 54 percent of assists at a time when the stakes are ratcheted up. Green and Mitchell are the team\u2019s top scorers and rebounders, while Releford leads Alabama in assists and Steele is a key role player.Grant said his decision to hold the players out had much to do with the long-term quality of the program and trying to build \u201cthe values and standards that you want your team to represent.\u201d He hasn\u2019t elaborated on the reasons for the suspensions.Grant declined to say if the violations of Mitchell and Green were more serious, but reiterated that their suspension remained indefinite.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that, that\u2019s just the way it is right now,\u201d he said.This is the third time Grant has suspended Green, a first-team All-SEC player, during his three seasons, including a three-game string early last season and one game at the end of 2009-10.Grant didn\u2019t rule it out when asked if he had a \u201cthree-strike\u201d policy that might keep Green from returning.\u201cI\u2019ll make some decisions on that later,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now my focus is on getting prepared for Florida.\u201dAlabama had risen to No. 12 in the rankings in December and won three straight before the LSU game.The bold decision on the suspensions was no surprise to Gators coach Billy Donovan, who was Grant\u2019s boss for a dozen years at Marshall and Florida.\u201cI know Anthony Grant about as well as anybody, and I think that he has got incredible integrity and character and knows exactly the way he wants his program run and what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Donovan said.The Tide\u2019s eight remaining players \u2014 half of them freshmen \u2014 managed to come fairly close before losing 67-58 to LSU, with freshman Rodney Cooper scoring 28 points. Alabama had beaten Auburn by 18 points without Mitchell.Now comes a much bigger challenge, even with Releford and Steele.The Gators (19-6, 7-3) opened last March with a 78-51 rout of a Tide team that still had aspirations of winning an SEC title and making the NCAA field.Florida is also short-handed, but because of injuries. The Gators won\u2019t have their top subs, forward Will Yeguete (concussion) and guard Mike Rosario (bruised hip), for the game, Donovan\n", "index": [[2425, 2433], [2795, 2805], [2911, 2918], [2940, 2954], [2959, 2972], [3013, 3026], [3051, 3066], [3161, 3176], [3486, 3491], [3788, 3795], [3836, 3841], [3852, 3857], [3859, 3867], [3923, 3926], [3978, 3988], [4036, 4044], [4108, 4131], [4287, 4292], [4297, 4305], [4355, 4363], [4421, 4426], [4667, 4672], [4710, 4718], [4723, 4728], [4906, 4911], [4926, 4931], [4950, 4953], [5071, 5076], [5157, 5162], [5276, 5283], [5375, 5378], [5453, 5466], [5476, 5481], [5510, 5518], [5523, 5530], [5539, 5552], [5721, 5728], [5847, 5850], [5918, 5924], [5946, 5954], [6000, 6008], [6135, 6138], [6160, 6164], [6171, 6178], [6350, 6357]], "wikipedia_ids": [30812226, 57690, 18933066, 29516337, 30957146, 17125894, 30812226, 507399, 17125894, 18933066, 17125894, 29516337, 30812226, 5978520, 105167, 30957146, 79371, 29516337, 30957146, 30812226, 17125894, 17125894, 30957146, 29516337, 17125894, 29516337, 79371, 17125894, 29516337, 18933066, 5978520, 1443634, 17125894, 560365, 18933066, 17125894, 1443634, 5978520, 2846320, 30957146, 30812226, 79371, 507399, 18933066, 1443634], "wikipedia_titles": ["Trevor Releford", "Montgomery, Alabama", "Florida", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Anthony Grant", "Trevor Releford", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Anthony Grant", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Trevor Releford", "LSU Tigers football", "Tuscaloosa, Alabama", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Southeastern Conference", "JaMychal Green", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Anthony Grant", "Anthony Grant", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "JaMychal Green", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Southeastern Conference", "Anthony Grant", "JaMychal Green", "Florida", "LSU Tigers football", "Billy Donovan", "Anthony Grant", "Marshall University", "Florida", "Anthony Grant", "Billy Donovan", "LSU Tigers football", "Auburn Tigers football", "Tony Mitchell (basketball, born 1989)", "Trevor Releford", "Southeastern Conference", "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament", "Florida", "Billy Donovan"]}

Across the country, fans saw the 54-32 final and may have no idea how unsettling it was at The Swamp at around 2:15 p.m. Saturday.Could they possibly lose to Furman?At the time, it looked very possible. At the time, you wondered if the Gator defense would make Furman punt the entire game. At the time, you wondered if anything else could go wrong.\u201cYou start to realize that if anything could go wrong, it already has,\u201d Will Muschamp said.Don't look for me to put a positive spin on this game.Sure, the Gators won by three touchdowns.Sure, Florida is bowl eligible.And yes, the Gators will get extra practices leading up to what is almost definitely a Gator Bowl appearance Jan. 2.\u201cIt's an extra spring practice,\u201d Muschamp said.Great. More practices we can't watch.But this win said as much about this season as the losses have.Because it was Furman.I know the Paladins came in here fired up for a chance to play in The Swamp. I know they changed their offense during the week and surprised the Gators.But that only accounts for the 67 yards (all on running plays) on Furman's first drive. What about the other 379?\u201cOnce we identified what they were doing, we played better,\u201d Muschamp said.After that first drive, Furman had 17 first downs and averaged 5.8 yards per play. That is not a good defense. If you saw it, you don't need the raw numbers to know how this defense didn't show up to play. The Gators missed enough tackles to fill a lowlight tape and so many times Furman running backs moved the pile as if they were being tackled by Pop Warner defenders.That's how it got to be 22-7 Furman after the first quarter. That's how that noise you heard if you had your windows open was the Gator fans who did show up squirming in their seats. That's how it was still a game early in the fourth quarter and I uttered a phrase I never thought I would in the fourth quarter of the Furman game -- \u201cThat was a huge field goal by Caleb Sturgis.\u201dIn the end, Florida won because it did the two things it hasn't done during the rest of the season.1. The wide receivers were a factor. They caught seven passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns. There was even a Quinton Dunbar sighting. The phenom of the preseason had a couple of big catches, including a touchdown reception.2. They had two pick-sixes. We had forgotten what those looked like. But the Gators iced the game with two nice plays from Pop Saunders and Jelani Jenkins, who had made a habit of dropping interceptions this season. \u201cI had visions of when I was in high school playing running back,\u201d Jenkins said of his 75-yard touchdown sprint.I heard a few boos Saturday when Florida fell behind by two touchdowns thanks in part to another snap over the head of quarterback John Brantley. There were more silly penalties, one on Matt Elam that set up Furman at the Florida 49 on the opening kickoff of the second half. There was the requisite 1-yard loss on a completed pass on third-and-7.And the offensive line continued to shuffle because of injuries, one of the reasons it was unable to open running lanes against a 6-5 FCS team.For much of the season, Gator fans have lamented that their team was just a few plays away from having a respectable record. This game made you wonder how they were competitive with Auburn, Georgia and South Carolina.Saturday was important for these Gators to become bowl eligible. But I'm not sure it showed that these Gators\n", "index": [[2416, 2430], [2434, 2458], [2490, 2501], [2503, 2506], [2770, 2776], [2884, 2900], [2981, 2988], [3045, 3049], [3156, 3163], [3210, 3216], [3239, 3246], [3268, 3287], [3293, 3299], [3402, 3411], [3572, 3578], [3731, 3744], [3889, 3895], [3963, 3973], [4227, 4236], [4306, 4312], [4379, 4385], [4487, 4495], [4525, 4531], [4711, 4717], [4782, 4788], [4851, 4861], [4901, 4907], [5190, 5196], [5236, 5249], [5263, 5270], [5656, 5662], [5719, 5733], [5862, 5869], [5940, 5947], [6038, 6051], [6093, 6102], [6115, 6121], [6129, 6136], [6388, 6391], [6579, 6585], [6587, 6594], [6599, 6613], [6647, 6653], [6717, 6723]], "wikipedia_ids": [965005, 1566104, 108959, 70551, 965005, 1919819, 6161011, 127628, 6161011, 134519, 6161011, 5566666, 965005, 1901861, 134519, 13775303, 965005, 335765, 1901861, 965005, 134519, 13775303, 134519, 965005, 134519, 2122783, 134519, 134519, 38423625, 6161011, 965005, 24050828, 24050828, 6161011, 9520883, 37591710, 134519, 6161011, 404595, 2846320, 2517159, 12931098, 965005, 965005], "wikipedia_titles": ["Florida Gators", "Ben Hill Griffin Stadium", "Gainesville, Florida", "Florida Panthers", "Florida Gators", "O'Connell Center", "Florida Gators football", "Elon, North Carolina", "Florida Gators football", "Furman, South Carolina", "Florida Gators football", "Friday Night Lights (TV series)", "Florida Gators", "Cajun Field", "Furman, South Carolina", "Will Muschamp", "Florida Gators", "Gator Bowl", "Cajun Field", "Florida Gators", "Furman, South Carolina", "Will Muschamp", "Furman, South Carolina", "Florida Gators", "Furman, South Carolina", "Pop Warner", "Furman, South Carolina", "Furman, South Carolina", "Caleb Sturgis", "Florida Gators football", "Florida Gators", "Jelani Jenkins", "Jelani Jenkins", "Florida Gators football", "John Brantley", "Matt Elam", "Furman, South Carolina", "Florida Gators football", "NCAA Division I Football Championship", "Auburn Tigers football", "Georgia Bulldogs football", "South Carolina Gamecocks football", "Florida Gators", "Florida Gators"]}

Durham and Nottinghamshire have shared the County Championship over the last three seasons and have two of the best balanced squads in England.\nDurham are one of the Twenty20 Cup North betting favourites because they have the best pace attack in the country.

Sellers have a few options available if their home stays on the market too long, including lowering the price, making some home improvements or renting their home while waiting for the market to improve.\n\u201cIn the DC area, most homes should sell within no more than 60 days if they are properly priced and in good condition,\u201d said Valerie Blake, an associate broker with Prudential Carruthers Realtors in the District. \u201cThere are three things that determine whether a home sells and for how much: location, condition and price. You can\u2019t control the location, so you have to look at the condition and price if something is not selling.\u201d\nHeather Elias, a Realtor with Century 21 Redwood Realty in Ashburn, Va., said sometimes the lack of an offer is market-dependent and sometimes it is simply about the house itself.\nFull story is available on The Washington Times\nFiled under:\u00a0Home Selling Advices\nSelling your home in a down market takes patience, right price\nPosted July 28, 2011\nComments(0)\nThe smell of Italian cooking that emanates throughout Eatontown resident Maria G.

The Forbes magazine has labelled real estate properties as one of the best income generating resources as well as the best returns in the last five years. Because of this, it has become a widespread feature many individuals covet of gaining ownership. However, how can you find a real estate investment? How do you figure out it is an exceptional asset opportunity?\nHaving a keen eye and knowing where to look are two qualities each individual must have in order to take the first step towards spotting real estate investment breaks.\nThe following are some useful tips that were compiled from successful investors:\n1.) Overcome hurdles.\nHearsay\u2019s are always surrounding us. All with different news that this property will reap you more rewards as compared to the other and vice versa. Or, you may constantly hear that real estate investments will not boom. In spite of these sayings and the unknowing things the future may hold, there are countless of ways to help you identify a good real estate investment opportunity that will be beneficial to you in the long run.\nWhat matters most is your own decision while at the same time, taking into consideration the opinions of professionals behind real estate such as real estate agents and brokers.\n2.) Take your time.\nA real estate investment is a lifetime duty. It is a serious matter that you must learn how to combine threading with caution and taking chances. Do not be pressured and buy the first property you see. Know the facts first, decipher and then decide.\n3.) Think out of the box.\u00a0 Rather more on profit than loss.\nMost often, individuals lose a great real estate investment opportunity because they dwell too much on the income loss first before foreseeing the returns it will generate them.\nWhile it is true that one must be wary of an investment\u2019s financial disadvantages, focusing more on the positive side will help you come up with more ideas.\nA home that was in a poor state before and has undergone renovation has great market and resale value as opposed to a home that is bought in good condition.\n4.) Choose a rich location.\nBy rich, it not only means that the people around the area must be from the high society class or living in an upstate area. It simply means that, a location wherein migration is abundant. A place wherein it is situated at the heart of the city life or it is convenient to office buildings, commercial establishments, schools, banks, hospitals, has a low crime rate, high rate of employment and the like.\nWhere you want to buy lies on your needs and wants and what is vacant as of now. When choosing a real estate investment, it is best that you first figure out what you want. This way, you narrow down your search into a shorter list. You can also do a one on one survey on each location that is listed. Making inquiries about it becomes a lot manageable.\n5.) Look out for newly opened facilities.\nWhenever a new service is being manufactured and people have been abuzz about it as well as it is well located, the possibility of attaining a real estate investment near this area is very good.\nResearch areas not only within your vicinity but as well as outside it. You never know there is a great opportunity in the country side. Gather up on tools such as the internet or a real estate company to help you determine more excellent openings.\n6.) Make a thorough inspection.\nA property whether it be a residential or commercial real estate must always be examined first hand before divulging into more transactions.\nA property\u2019s overall state, the foundation and structure of the building and electrical wiring\u2019s are only some important aspects to look out for.\nAsk for permits and other documentations that will prove that the real estate is valid.\nA great investor knows how to spot opportunities in hindsight, regardless if it is developed or underdeveloped. Arm yourself with the right skills and always practice being careful. Take chances. Be open. In no time, you will reap off the rewards of your well-thought out decisions.\nFiled under:\u00a0Real Estate Investment\nHow to Steer Clear From Common Home Buying Mistakes?\nPosted July 28, 2011\nComments(0)\nEvery individual desires to own a home to call their own. Naturally, you want a place to stay that exudes appeal and provides comfort. At the same time, owning a residential real estate is also a great investment to have these days. You can reap profits with its home value or just by simply reselling it. Also, you can obtain financial assistance by using your home\u2019s equity. There are many uses a home can bring. That is why, it is essential to invest smart and avoid falling into the pitfall of home buying mistakes most individuals are susceptible to make.\nOwning a home is supposedly to bring joy and a sense of completion to any individual. However, there are just those pesky home buying mistakes that seemingly arise out of nowhere that causes conflicts in the whole home buying process. In order to avoid making them, it is advised that you gain knowledge about these general errors. Here are some tips.\nStart It By Doing Your Homework\nIt is your assignment to make some research about the whole home ownership process, from the hiring of a professional to locating the best priced property to obtaining a housing loan for back-up. Learn up by scouting on real estate books and understand the issues well. The internet is one of the best ways to instantly gain knowledge about residential buying since it has extensive websites and real estate online libraries that can help you grasp the basics. Online chat forums about real estate are also present. What\u2019s more great about it is that there are numerous real estate agents online that can answer your queries and shed some light to your doubts.\nTry asking your friends, relatives and co-workers who are home owners for some information. Or, go to your state\u2019s real estate firm and seek professional advice.\nFailure to Get Pre-approved Mortgage Loan\nWhen it comes to buying a house, most home buyers are in need of fiscal assistance to support this purchase. Obtaining a home is costly and it can cause a huge burden in your finances. Applying for a mortgage loan will help you completely gain tenure of a property. Plus, a loan like this will serve as your basis as to how much you can afford. This way, your house hunting will be categorized under your budget. This gives sellers an idea that you are totally serious of finding a home.\nEnsure A Valid Contract\nAs a home buyer, your home contract must be entitled of your protection. Meaning, they must the three C\u2019s or contingency sections. First, is the inspection contingency which gives the buyer the right to terminate the contract once you spot countless of damages in the house. Second, is the appraisal contingency which states that the appraisal of the house must meet and not surpass the property\u2019s purchase cost. Lastly, is the mortgage financing contingency which defends the buyer if you are not able to qualify for a mortgage loan.\nThink Long Term\nIt is very likely that you will live in this house for many years, but it is also possible that you will move on to another residence for the coming years. So, it is best to think on a long term. This is an investment that must be done with assurance. Consider possible circumstances like when your family will grow or when you plan to sell it. See to it that the house you will buy has an excellent resale value or its market value increases every year.\nDo A Walk-through\nThis is also one of the most essential steps when house buying. Most people shun this idea away especially when they already saw pictures of the residence. But, what you do not know is that sellers stage their home and hire professional photographers that make their homes very appealing. Do it personally and visit the house. You can even ask help from a home inspection agency or a real estate appraiser to aid you with the property\u2019s real condition and value.\nInspect every area of the house, spot any possible defects that needs minor to major repairs. In this way, sellers know about it and will even possibly give you a discount on the selling price since you still have to shell out money for renovations.\nBy being aware of the potential errors that come with buying a home and knowing how to counteract them, the road to this whole process will be as smooth as possible.\nFiled under:\u00a0Home Buying Advices\nA Home Buyer\u2019s Guide to Avoiding Contract Closing Dilemmas\nPosted July 28, 2011\nComments(0)\nIn the business of real estate, there are two things that happen \u2013 either the seller proposes to the buyer to purchase the house or the buyer sends an offer to the seller to buy the house. After which, the transaction commences and will only be considered as a closed deal once both parties involved have finished the home ownership process as well agreed to practice the whole agreement. However, there are times when closing a contract will be terminated due to unsatisfactory conditions. In order to avoid dealing with this situation, it is best that home buyers get a clear picture first of how the whole process works.\nThere are a few things that must be aired out when it comes to closing a home buyer contract. As the buyer, your main goal is to make sure that you secure tenure of the property especially if the house for sale is your dream house. It is also your responsibility to be well-informed and courteous in terms of transacting with the seller. For a seller, you must also maintain a fair deal. Meaning, what was settled is final and your home for sale must be reserved to the buyer who is almost near the requirements completion. Once these are met, the whole process will be 100% effective.\nWays to Avoid Contract Closing Issues\n1.) Apply for a mortgage loan ahead of time.\nQualifying for a housing loan these days is not easy as it was before. When you wish to obtain a mortgage loan to help you (as a buyer) finance the cost of your soon to be home, apply ahead of time. Take note that most sellers move on fast to another prospective home buyer when you are not able to produce any financing on the stipulated deadline. Having ample time to get your housing assistance will eliminate the chances of your contract termination.\n2.) Know the contract\u2019s starting date.\nUsually, the date indicated in the contract is not really the specified time for the contract to commence. It is vital that you know when the contract\u2019s date is effective; otherwise all you have is a void piece of paper. There are given number of days for requirements to be done such as loan application and approval, home inspection and title holder.\n3.) Have all your documents ready.\nMost often, closing of contract is delayed or ceased because home buyers neglect to tend to their legal papers. So, before you go into the whole home purchasing phase, it is best for you to know if all needed documents are present. Check if they are valid and information\u2019s displayed are up to date.\n4.) Be present during home inspection.\nYes, home inspectors are hired to spot possible defects and needed repairs easier for you. But, do keep in mind that they are entirely different from one another. Some inspectors are overly picky while others do not mind at all. So in order to avoid any arguments between you and the seller, you must be in attendance when home inspection is being held.\n5.) Ask assistance from a real estate agent.\nThis will help you make the job easier since the agent is in charge of it and understands everything that goes into the process.\n6.) Hire a real estate appraiser.\nEmploy an appraiser that is familiar with the community or someone who works within the locality. This way, appraisal of the home\u2019s value is correct. This avoids almost half of the obstacles that may cause contract closing problems.\n7.) Let everyone sign the contract.\nIf the house for sale is owned by a family or a couple, then see to it that you get each individual to sign up the contract in order to avoid faulty contracts or any misleading issues that will cause problems.\n8.) Make a review.\nDays before the closing of contract, see to it that you review all the things indicated on the paper. Also, it will help to let the seller go over the contract once again to eliminate any issues. If there are any adjustments, then both parties still have time to deal with it that will still make the transaction come into a successful close.\nClosing contracts are not that dreadful as most people perceive it to be. As long as you are attentive, thorough and responsible, the whole home buying process will just be a walk in the park.\nFiled under:\u00a0Home Buying Advices\nUS Housing Market Suffers from Contract Cancellations\nPosted July 28, 2011\nComments(0)\nExisting residential property sales in the United States eased back in June as contract cancellations spiked unexpectedly, although prices were up slightly, according to the latest report from the National Association of Realtors.\nSales gains in the Midwest and South were offset by declines in the Northeast and West. Single family home sales were stable while the condo sector weakened, the report shows.\nTotal existing home sales, which are completed transactions that include single family, town homes, condominiums and co-ops, fell 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.77 million in June from 4.81 million in May, and remain 8.8% below the 5.23 million unit level in June 2010, which was the scheduled closing deadline for the home buyer tax credit.\n\u2018Home sales had been trending up without a tax stimulus, but a variety of issues are weighing on the market including an unusual spike in contract cancellations in the past month,\u2019 said Lawrence Yun, NAR economist.\n\u2018The underlying reason for elevated cancellations is unclear, but with problems including tight credit and low appraisals, 16% of NAR members report a sales contract was cancelled in June, up from 4% in May, which stands out in contrast with the pattern over the past year,\u2019 he explained.\n\u2018Pending home sales were down in April but up in May, so we may be seeing some of that mix in closed sales for June. However, economic uncertainty and the federal budget debacle may be causing hesitation among some consumers or lenders,\u2019 he added.\nFull story is available on NuWireInvestor\nFiled under:\u00a0Home Selling Advices\nAhead of the Bell: New home sales\nPosted July 27, 2011\nComments(0)\nMore people likely purchased new homes in June than the previous\nmonth, although sales are expected to remain below healthy levels.\nEconomists forecast that new-home sales rose to a seasonally\nadjusted annual rate of 323,000 in June, according to a survey by\nFactSet. The Commerce Department will release the report at 10 a.m.\nTuesday.\nIn May, sales fell 2.1 percent to an annual rate of 319,000.\nThat\u2019s less than half the 700,000 homes per year that economists say is\ntypical in healthy markets.\nIn a separate report Tuesday, Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller\nwill release its home-price index for May. The index measures home\nprices in 20 of the largest US metro areas. It sank in March to its\nlowest levels since 2002. It rebounded slightly in April because of a\ntraditional influx of spring buying.\nFull story is available on Business Week\nFiled under:\u00a0Home Selling Advices\nHome-Buying Regrets: Two Military Families\u2019 Sagas\nPosted July 27, 2011\nComments(0)\nFirst of a three-part series\nIt\u2019s\nlunchtime, and Sarah Bullard and her four kids gather around the island\nin the kitchen of their Bristol, RI, home.

(By now most if not all of you know that a short sale is a home sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage, if the lender approves the deal.)\nDonovan writes:\n\u201cKeep your uncooperative tenant\n\u201cThis one is a biggie. If you really want to torpedo your short sale, make certain that your tenant refuses to allow access to potential buyers or even worse to your agent so that s/he can take pictures of the house. This will make it very hard to complete your short sale successfully.\n\u201cWhy?\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for your Realtor to sell your short sale if it can\u2019t be seen. If you do get an offer, it\u2019s likely to be from an investor who will not likely give you fair market value offer without being able to see the property.\nFull story is available on OCRegister\nFiled under:\u00a0Home Foreclosure,Home Selling Advices\nNew home sales slip while prices and mortgage rates rise, sort of\nPosted July 27, 2011\nComments(0)\nHouse prices rose in May on both the 10- and 20-city composite\nindices and in 16 of the 20 metropolitan areas surveyed.

The account was allegedly funded by investor money and used to make payments into Stanford's personal accounts.If DOJ concludes that the bank ignored potential criminal activity, the report said, that could be the basis for prosecution under federal anti-money laundering statutes.WSJ said the probe shows that after more than two years investigators still are trying to unravel the global fraud alleged by Stanford and associates.Prosecutors say Stanford's \"secret account\" was accessed only by him and James Davis, his former chief financial officer from Baldwyn.Davis pleaded guilty to his part in the scheme in the fall of 2009 and has been helping the government with its case. He's been living on his wife's family farm in Michigan ever since.patsy.brumfield@journalinc.com\nCopyright 2012 djournal.com.
